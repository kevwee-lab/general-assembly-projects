,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,438,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,438,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Back in 5th grade, we had this teacher who would collect money for school trips, and pizza parties, then put them in a table that's opened for everyone to see. The table was right behind the carpet that we sat on every morning. The teacher collected $5 from every single kid for a pizza lunch, we only get 1 slice for $5, and there were 24 kids in the class, $5x24=$120. Now 2 boxes of pizzas with 12 slices in each of them only costed $22.6 tax included. $120-$22.6=$97.4 profit for the school. $97.4 profit? I was like ""damn, they making a killing from ripping us off like this every 2 months with the whole school getting pizza lunch, I'm taking my $5 back, screw them"". I then sat VERY close to the desk in the morning, and when everyone was getting up and practically covering me from the teacher's point of view, I grabbed one of the envelopes that had $5 in them, and shoved it into my pocket. No one noticed, I was in the clear.  


Then Pizza lunch day came... Steve went up to the teacher when everyone else was eating pizza, and asked where his slice is. The teacher said he didn't get Steve's $5 or form for the pizza lunch..

The table was right behind the carpet that we sat on every morning. The teacher collected $5 from every single kid for a pizza lunch, we only get 1 slice for $5, and there were 24 kids in the class, $5x24=$120. Now 2 boxes of pizzas with 12 slices in each of them only costed $22.6 tax included. $120-$22.6=$97.4 profit for the school. $97.4 profit? I was like &amp;quot;damn, they making a killing from ripping us off like this every 2 months with the whole school getting pizza lunch, I&amp;#39;m taking my $5 back, screw them&amp;quot;. I then sat VERY close to the desk in the morning, and when everyone was getting up and practically covering me from the teacher&amp;#39;s point of view, I grabbed one of the envelopes that had $5 in them, and shoved it into my pocket. No one noticed, I was in the clear.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Pizza lunch day came... Steve went up to the teacher when everyone else was eating pizza, and asked where his slice is. The teacher said he didn&amp;#39;t get Steve&amp;#39;s $5 or form for the pizza lunch.. Apparently I grabbed the wrong envelope... So poor Steve didn&amp;#39;t get pizza that day.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame.

We even threw a few on the newly built football place from the 3rd floor and even some near kids, thus splattering them with yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we were done (we did all this in 10 minutes and somehow we didnt get spotted) we see the principal and the janitors walk in. I was scared sh!tless! And so was my friend. 
The principal begins to say something among these lines.
-Militaru (the name of some kid from my class) why did you do all that in the bathroom and field! All the kids from the other classes said you did it! You either clean that up or i will drop a point on your behavioral grade!
Militaru freakes out and he said that he didnt do it and stuff. 
But the thing is Militaru was known troughout the school to cause mischief and the fact that he was a liar.
That damn kid cleaned every single yogurt stain snd afterwards he had to apologise to the kids and the parents of the kids. He doesnt know who did it to this day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways at the end of the evening I asked him to go get some ice down the hallway and then I never let him back into the room. I think it&amp;#39;s important to pay your call boys and I feel bad for doing it at the time but I was kind of tight on money.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I was probably 16 or 17 at the time. Still a kid in high school. A young couple moved Into the house next to mine. As soon as they moved in they already gave off creepy/weird vibes. It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc. 

One day during the summer I was home alone and my neighbors weren’t home (assuming they were at work as it was 1pm or so) and I get the idea to sneak into their house. I was just way too curious and needed more information on what kind of people they were. I wasn’t planning on stealing anything. I walk to their back door and slowly open up the door. To my surprise it was unlocked. I walked in and started to snoop around. There was nothing unusual about the house other than the fact that it smelled like heavy cigarette or marijuana smoke and the house was a mess. I snooped all through the downstairs and didn’t find anything interesting. Just usual house things. I head upstairs and began snooping around. There wasn’t much upstairs either as most of the bedrooms were just filled with boxes since they lived there alone. I make my way into the master bedroom and my god this bedroom was an absolute mess. There was clothes and dirty dishes everywhere and it smelled like heavy marijuana. I make my way to their nightstand and on top of it was a HUGE bag of weed and a bong (thought about taking some from the bag for myself since there was so much but figured I better not). I started looking through the drawers and ended up finding things I didn’t need to see like dildos, condoms, lube etc. I decided that I better leave before they come home and find me looking through their house. 

I made my way back to my house and was pretty underwhelmed with what I had found. I was expecting to find something crazy like a secret room full of dead bodies or something.

Still a kid in high school. A young couple moved Into the house next to mine. As soon as they moved in they already gave off creepy/weird vibes. It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day during the summer I was home alone and my neighbors weren’t home (assuming they were at work as it was 1pm or so) and I get the idea to sneak into their house. I was just way too curious and needed more information on what kind of people they were. I wasn’t planning on stealing anything. I walk to their back door and slowly open up the door. To my surprise it was unlocked. I walked in and started to snoop around. There was nothing unusual about the house other than the fact that it smelled like heavy cigarette or marijuana smoke and the house was a mess. I snooped all through the downstairs and didn’t find anything interesting. Just usual house things. I head upstairs and began snooping around. There wasn’t much upstairs either as most of the bedrooms were just filled with boxes since they lived there alone. I make my way into the master bedroom and my god this bedroom was an absolute mess. There was clothes and dirty dishes everywhere and it smelled like heavy marijuana. I make my way to their nightstand and on top of it was a HUGE bag of weed and a bong (thought about taking some from the bag for myself since there was so much but figured I better not). I started looking through the drawers and ended up finding things I didn’t need to see like dildos, condoms, lube etc. I decided that I better leave before they come home and find me looking through their house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way back to my house and was pretty underwhelmed with what I had found. I was expecting to find something crazy like a secret room full of dead bodies or something. The only interesting thing I learned from them was that they were potheads (I was at the time too so good for them). After this I continued to spy on them here and there just out of pure curiosity.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

&lt;p&gt;Because I hadn&amp;#39;t thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing it&amp;#39;s been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn&amp;#39;t shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter&amp;#39;s phlegmy nostrils. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Helped poorly daughter to breathe by sucking the entire contents of her nose into my mouth and swallowing. Have mild PTSD from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it&amp;#39;s been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I&amp;#39;ve been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn&amp;#39;t fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using &amp;quot;fat burning&amp;quot; creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn&amp;#39;t do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; stopped being extreme in my dieting. I&amp;#39;m trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can&amp;#39;t retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend&amp;#39;s healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it&amp;#39;s ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today. Now I&amp;#39;ll go back to my boring life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,433,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,433,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,437,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,437,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,439,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,439,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,436,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,436,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,443,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,443,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,441,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,441,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.

,confession,"I told everyone I was 230 lbs when I started my weight loss journey last summer. Truthfully, I was 210 lbs but I *had been* 230 lbs but I lost those 20 lbs at the beginning of 2020. It just seemed better to say I lost that much weight when I talked about it to friends and family and I was proud of myself. 

Since last summer and up to now, I lost 80 lbs...but with my lie, I had to say I lost 100 lbs. I now weigh about 130 lbs, more or less at. I posted about my weight loss on social media, thinking only my friends and family would only see it but now it's been shared thousands of times because a friend of a friend is a fitness coach that saw it and shared it with her followers. People asked me how I lost the weight and I've been lying to them. Sprouting the same generic thing everyone says. Healthy eating and moderate exercise. Abs are made in the kitchen. Walks and staying active. Yoga and meditation.

How I really lost all that weight was through intermittent and water fasting for up to 4-5 days at a time, eating only a cup of food when I wasn't fasting, dieting tea, laxatives, exercising only an hour once week, and finding cheat ways to lose weight faster such as using training corsets, using ""fat burning"" creams, and drinking apple cider vinegar to name a few. (The only thing I didn't do was take dieting pills since they always make me sick.) Totally not healthy, totally not smart but it worked for me. I have minimal loose skin and I dropped the pounds like crazy but I *have* stopped being extreme in my dieting. I'm trying to incorporate weights and cardio into my life but that stuff is HARD.

I also can't retract anything I said now because I did agree to be a featured story on that friend of a friend's healthy lifestyle page on her social media platform. Being called an inspiration only makes me feel guiltier for lying but if it helps other women to get in shape and be motivated then I guess it's ok? Since then, I kept my account private and stopped responding to messages. Just needed an outlet today.

&lt;p&gt;My best friend always had money. One day him and I were walking home from the park and he dropped a $20 out of his pocket. I quickly put my foot over it to hide it as he looked for it. I remember him asking &amp;quot;did you pick it up?&amp;quot; and I lied with a no. After he couldn&amp;#39;t find it we kept walking. You could tell that he didn&amp;#39;t really care that he lost it because money wasn&amp;#39;t a thing to him. His house was before mine so once he was home, instead of going to my house I walked to a subway up the street and got a sandwich with his money. I still think about it now and hate that I did it. THE WORST PART is I walked home from Subway and my mom had bought groceries so basically, if I had just stuck it out, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have stolen from him...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, but it gives me an out whenever I need to escape from the most boring work meetings: I can rap on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly listening to rap so I&amp;#39;m ready to go any time, any place. I pretend not to notice until everyone is practically dying from second hand embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to make a long-winded, profuse apology like &amp;quot;omg guys I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I’m gonna have an outburst again, I&amp;#39;m so sorry it&amp;#39;s my ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was sitting in an all-staff quarterly update  I just shout &amp;quot;blicky got the stiffy, uh&amp;quot; and excused myself immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one questions the frequency of my outbursts, and I can&amp;#39;t be fired because it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. It works everytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve started rapping on the subway so no one sits next to me. Guess what? No one sits next to me on a crowded train car.&lt;/p&gt;

Lila used to sign herself up for the 40 Hour Famine every year, but she never actually went 40 hours without food, like you’re meant to. 

One day I was at her place and she had the official book with her that people wrote their names and donations in. She copied it all onto a page of an exercise book, and wondered whether we could make some money. Her mother encouraged us to go out and see what we could scrounge out.

We spent over an hour going around the block, knocking on doors, and charming people into giving us money. We ended up with at least $20.

We went back to Lila’s place and marvelled at what we’d managed to do, and how much junk food we could buy with it. Lila’s Mum told us to go to the corner store and get her a pack of cigarettes, and we could spend the rest on whatever we wanted.

I can’t recall whether we got the cigarettes or not, as around this time, it was illegal for minors to buy cigarettes. But we did come back with tons of junk food.
This was the mid ‘90s and lollies were really cheap so we ended up with more than we could eat in one day.
Didn’t feel any remorse at the time, but I feel really shitty about it now.

,confession,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&amp;#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",t2_13kdoc,False,,0,False,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod Post'}]",r/confession,False,7,Mod Post,0,,False,t3_ft4ijw,False,dark,0.99,,public,440,8,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Post,False,440,,False,,1591402481.0,,[],{},,True,,1585791715.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.confession,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules.

,confession,"Okay, I'm going to try to be as honest as possible and not sugar-coat anything.

There's this person who I see regularly. We're not friends, not even acquaintances, but we see each other. I find her attractive. I also have what is probably a chronic masturbation addiction. So, on multiple occasions I have taken videos of her without her consent or knowledge. Just to be clear, this was in a public area that is monitored by cameras. I didn't follow her into the bathroom or anything like that. I'm not saying that to try to justify my actions or to say ""At least I didn't..."" or anything like that, I swear. I'm simply trying to establish context and make it clear exactly what it is that I did. I took videos of her on multiple occasions, masturbated to them, and usually deleted them after a few days or within the day due to guilt. This is actually something I did multiple times throughout highschool, as well. All of those videos were also deleted, of course. And while they were deleted out of guilt, it wasn't as profound as the shame I felt that caused me to delete these last couple of videos. Maybe it's because I've matured a bit and become more aware of other people. Although clearly I'm not mature or empathetic enough to actually respect other people and, you know, not take creepy videos of them. Or maybe it's because I feel differently about this person. At first it was just pure infatuation or lust. And it still is that. But a part of it is more than that. I think a part of me has developed an obsessive crush on this person. And it's only made me feel more ashamed and disgusted with myself for demeaning, objectifying, and disrespecting her. I violated her privacy and I did it with such selfish and disgusting intentions. And I want to make it clear that I'm mentioning the guilt and shame that I feel to highlight how wrong what I did was and that I know it was wrong. I'm not trying to garner sympathy or show that I'm a good person just because I feel guilty. I should feel this way. I deserve to feel this way. And, sure, a worse person wouldn't feel any remorse. But a good person wouldn't have done it at all. Again, I don't want to sugar-coat that. In fact, let me prove just how much of a shitty person I am. I would probably do it again. I still think about doing it. I'd like to say that I respect her enough as a living, breathing, thinking human being to not treat her like an object, but I don't know if my guilt is more powerful than my lust. And I guess maybe that's why I'm posting this. To get at least some of it off my chest, sure. But I guess I'm hoping that sharing it might make it feel like less of a secret. When it's a secret, I can make the excuse that nobody knows. But hopefully talking about it will help me change my habits.

So, please, if you've managed to make it this far, tell me your take on this whole situation. Please be as brutally honest with me as possible. If you just think I'm a piece of shit, then tell me I'm a piece of shit. If you think I'm making excuses for my actions, please let me know. I want to know.

There is graffiti hand carved onto the door (this is a metal door, so whoever did it used some reasonable strength). So yeah, the place is decent overall but can be a bit rough. The other day, I went out and one of my handsfree (ear) audio devices fell out. Straight thru the small opening, fell right under the lift floor. I was gutted. I knew that the lift needed maintenance as one of the features was already cracked. I politely asked the manager if they could have someone come and give it a wellness check and also retrieve my audio device. They stated that they were overwhelmed and didn't give me a solid answer when that could actually happen.

I was a bit dejected but was like fine, ok, I get it. I left for a walk. When I came back, I had been caught in a terrible rain storm and was also dealing with horrible anxiety and just feeling like hell. Said lift has a shitty alarm that goes off if it is held open for too long. I snapped and in a fit of pure anger I hit the piece of the lift where the ear piercing sound was coming from to get it to stop. It didn't. It further cracked off the entire, already broken piece. I felt bad but didn't think much of it as I was so upset with other stuff. I thought, oh well, it will get overlooked like so much else does in this place. But then I later thought if they have to come out and fix things, they can help me get my audio piece.

The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might've busted it by accident. He said, ""oh they didn't say anything to the manager?"" I'm thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he's going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??

Now I'm horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.

&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were fixing the lift. The lift guy told me that this is the second time this has happened on this property (I knew nothing of the first incident). I told the guy that there were quite the number of questionable people living here now and there were a bunch of moving guys hauling giant pieces of equipment into the elevator the other day and that they might&amp;#39;ve busted it by accident. He said, &amp;quot;oh they didn&amp;#39;t say anything to the manager?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m thinking, do you seriously think that some exhausted moving dude making minimum wage is gonna give a crap about a part he busted in an old, janky elevator? Like he&amp;#39;s going to go running to the higher ups and admit this??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m horrified that I will get called out by the manager. There are no cameras anywhere, but still it looks bad. There is literally no proof it was me who completely broke the lift piece except for the coincidence of me asking for lift maintenance/ear piece rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my recovering Catholic guilt is running amuck :( I can&amp;#39;t get charged or accused of anything without proof, right? Again, I do feel terrible but justified - it needed fixing as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"I never used reddit before but after hearing so much about this confession board I thought i could finally ease my conscious a little bit by saying the truth about the car crash me and my sister were involved with. I will keep it simple, me and my sister, who was driving were driving from my grandmother's house home through the city, mind you it was evening and not too busy. I don't know why we had fought, but I know we were just sitting in silence no one saying anything, I was immersed in my own thoughts and just kind of looking ahead but you know when you zone out and don't really see what you're looking at. Like that. I saw in the corner of my eyes my sister just typing on her phone as she often does. 

I think she was 19 at the time, it's been a while. I was always one to be overly cautious and always told her to stop playing around on her phone, but this time I didn't. I should have. But like I said we weren't talking because of some trivial fight. So we drove along this long hill, the street dipped in orange and suddenly i see this white cab turning left. I remember thinking ""huh... Aren't we heading towards this car-"" It was strange because as stupid as it sounds it was slightly slow motion but not really. Before I could even open my mouth or think of warning my sister I took a deep breath, I knew on the inside I had to brace myself for the impact. It was like instinct I guess. 

And sure enough it came. Next thing i know there is smoke everywhere and I just see the inflated airbag which to my surprise was very thin, I touched it slightly trying to organise my thoughts and I looked over to my sister, she was okay. She choked out probably in shock, ""are you okay?... don't tell them. Don't tell them. Please. PROMISE ME.""
I said nothing I just looked at her as she pleaded, I knew what she meant. She meant don't tell them she was on the phone not paying attention. The cars both were totalled. This in itself is bad right, but you see the taxi driver had also made a mistake he had made an illegal turn, yes illegal but there was not much traffic and he was trying to get to the other side of the road to where his client had lived, an elderly lady. Okay now you may think okay so that's bad but where is the guilty part? There were witnesses. A nice couple who ran to my sister's defense, as the taxi driver was shouting at her that she should have paid attention (he didn't know about the phone). The witnesses hadn't seen the phone either, they had only seen the cab pulling over the straight line. So that's the narrative that continued, the taxi driver got all the blame. We got all the insurance, because it wasn't our fault. Of course I had to give a statement. I lied. For my sister. My sister who was working towards becoming a bus driver for the government here (in my country those are very very well paid jobs), mainly to make my father proud who is the one of the higher ups in the transport division.

In the end it is years later down the line now, she is a bus driver for the government, lives a great life. I remember this because it came up in a conversation and my father likes to say some stupid line like ""stupid cab drivers"" still holding a grudge thinking this driver had endangered his daughter's life. My sister still looks at me whenever it comes up just smiling ""I know you won't say anything.""

Added: I do feel guilty and I wish I could go back and warn her. But what can I do? Obvious answer yes say the truth but it's my sister it would probably be the biggest betrayal.

,confession,"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate a couple of years ago and we bought a smart TV for the living room together. Once the pandemic began, we both started working from home. Since his room was smaller, he started working from the living room and I had my desk in my own room. It was all going fine but then he got into a habit of keeping the TV on in the background while he worked and this was distracting to me because I could hear it through the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got to a point where it was annoying to tell him every day to reduce the volume so I set up the app on my phone that lets you operate the TV without the remote. My roommate somehow does not know that such a thing exists. Since then, instead of getting up from my desk and asking him to turn down the TV, I just reduce the volume from my phone. I sometimes just switch off the TV for fun and he has to find the remote to turn it on. Sometimes, I do that while I am watching it with him just so he doesn't get suspicious. I told him it might be happening because of interference from some other apartment's remote and he just bought it.

,confession,"I was 17 at the time when I stupidly drove home after drinking heavily at my step-parent’s house. At that point in my life I was very clearly an alcoholic and because of my addiction I left a group of young adults to fend for themselves.

I was cautiously driving home down the backroads from the house I had been drinking at. This person lived out in the country and many of these roads were very curvy. A particular road curve I know better than to go over 15mph because it will fling you into a large sized ditch. It was night time and I’m reaching that point in the road so I slow down and then suddenly I see headlights flying from the other direction.

It was a younger couple maybe in their late 20s at the time. I would always spy on them out of my bedroom window because they would do weird things like stand on the porch for hours at a time. Literally doing nothing other than just standing. I could also see straight through their kitchen window at night when their lights were on and I could see them doing weird body motions. They could have definitely just been talking but they were always doing unnatural movements like flailing there arms in the air, sometimes jumping up and down etc.

,confession,"My baby is 5 months old and has her first ever cold. The poor thing has no idea why she's ill and probably thinks that this is her life now as she desperately tries so suck her dummy (pacifier) with a blocked nose, crying with every failed breath. 

Now, as part of my research into things you need when you're expecting I came across this thing called a snot sucker. It's exactly what it sounds like: a rubber tube with a slim piece on one end to stick into baby's plugged up nose and a fatter end to stick into your mouth as you suck all the gooey slime from the nostrils of your bunged up bundle of joy. It's exactly as horrendous as you're imagining right now, and over the past week or so I've managed to clear what feels like a swimming pool of snot from my beautiful little angel. 

This morning, after an unusually early 5am start, because little one couldn't breathe yet again, I brought her into bed with me for her first nap, in the hopes that some cuddles would help her feel better enough to sleep. However as anyone who has ever had a cold knows, as soon as she was horizontal the snot dam plugged again and suffocation ensued. 

At this point I'd been up with her for three hours. She hadn't eaten because of the lack of oxygen when the bottle went in, and we were both about to pass out. I was damned if I was going to get out of my nice warm bed to traipse around the house searching for the small rubber tube that makes the baby scream any time it goes within 6 inches of her face. 

And then it happened. I didn't think about it for more than a quarter of a second, but in that extremely short space of time I'd already moved my mouth towards the glistening stream of goo pouring out of the nose of my second-born infant and sucked. I reasoned that if my mouth could get snot out through a tube, then surely it could bypass the middle man and get the job done on its own. I was more right than I could ever have possibly imagined. 

What slid out of her nose and into my mouth was indescribable. It was huge. The vacuum of my lips against her face must have allowed me to extract way more than the snot sucker ever could, with its thin tube and terrible seal. And now the monstrous bogey was there, inside my mouth, like a boiled oyster left out too long on a warm day.  

Because I hadn't thought through my decision to even go in in the first place there was no way I could have foreseen the horror of my situation. Gigantic bogey in my mouth, baby now happily breathing silently while lying on my arm and so close to sleep that I would rather have cut off my own arm than move and dusturb her. I almost wish I had cut my own arm off, because then I did the only thing I could do... I swallowed. 

At the time of writing it's been about 10 hours and I can still feel it. The size of it, the texture (oh, the texture) and the slight saltiness of it will live on in my memory until my dying day. 

Yes, my baby slept peacefully in my arms after that, and yes, she hasn't shown a hint of a sniffle all day. But at what cost? Every sneeze or sniff she ever has will, forevermore, take me back not only to the moment of sheer desperation to make sure my baby could breathe and we could both get some sleep, but also to the moment I sucked out and swallowed the entire contents of my daughter's phlegmy nostrils.

,confession,"This was more than 5 years ago when I was in high school. I went out to a restaurant with my two older brothers and their friends. The server was some kid around my age at the time and he was really quiet and wasn’t really saying much. I think it was his first week cause he looked nervous. 

So after we’re done eating, we go to the front to pay. I had barely got a debit card so I wasn’t familiar how to use it and we were each paying for our own meal. So I’m the last one to pay and I have extreme anxiety. So my older brother and his friends were waiting for me and I’ve always thought my brother’s friends were cute so this made me more anxious cause they were all staring at me. 

And I’m talking to the girl at the front and I tell her how I don’t know what I’m doing since I hadn’t used my card before. So she’s walking me through the steps and then another server comes up and says hi to me cause we were going to the same school. And this guy was also pretty cute so my anxiety is increasing and I just wanna get out of the restaurant as soon as I can.

Then the girl who’s helping me gets to the tip section and says that I can write the tip and she joked that I could write $0 

And so my anxious ass wasn’t really paying attention to her cause the other server was still talking to me and my older brother’s cute friends were all staring at me and I just wanted to leave.

So out of desperation of getting out of the restaurant I just had the “$0” in my head so I wrote that in and left in a hurry.

,confession,"When I was a kid I was pretty naive and weird, I didn't understand social cues and it was hard for me to make friends. I started elementary school and no one wanted to be my friend, groups started forming and I was all alone. But I wasn't the only one. There was this girl in my class. We became friends, we genuinely liked each other, she was a great kid, she was funny and chill, we started sitting together 'cause no one else wanted to sit with us. I was too young and naive to understand that she was different, I honestly saw her as a regular kid, but years later I realized why nobody wanted to talk to her and everybody made fun of her. She was mentally challenged. At the time she was maybe a couple of years behind us (intelligence-wise), but she was in my class for 8 years, and even when we were 14 she had the brain of a 4 year old. We kept getting along great, keeping each other company while all other kids disregarded us. Then they started mocking her more and more. And... I don't even remember how it happened, or how I took the decision, but I started doing the same in order to be accepted by the rest of the class. Quickly I stopped talking to her, became friends with other kids and made fun of her with them. Honestly, she still seemed like a normal child to me, I didn't understand why we were mocking her but I repeated what my new friends said to her, I didn't wanna be left out. She gradually accepted that I no longer wanted to be her friend and moved on. 

A few years later she became to develop sexually (she was like 10, very early) and she suddenly grew enormous breasts. Suddenly we started showing some interest in her, while still treating her like a freak. We'd take her behind a blackboard with wheels at recess and ask her to show us her breasts. She didn't mind. She let us touch them, she even showed us her vagina one time. I didnt' understand how wrong that was, to me it was just funny, it seemed I'd forgotten we had been friends in first year in the first place. She became someone to exploit for our own interest. Jesus Christ...

One day I told my parents about this like it was a funny story. They didn't laugh, but didn't comment on it either. The next day our teacher told us we were not to go behind the blackboard anymore, and reprimanded us and told us he was disgusted, without really saying what he was disgusted about. The blackboard thing stopped, I was so clueless i didn't even think that it was my parents that told on us. I realized years later, when I stopped being so naive.

As I said, we were in the same class for 8 years, and in middle school we all stopped mocking her, I guess we all grew up. Truth is, I was so desperate to be accepted that I would have kept doing it if everyone else did. Instead, we just ignored her, dismissed her, pretended she didn't exist. She probably forgot about our initial friendship.

Honestly, this story never bothered me for years. I am 25 now, and I was 23 when it all came back to me, and I analyzed it all with a grown man's mind. I realized how awful this was. I feel horrible. I still think about it often. Ironically, when I moved towns at 14 years old all my friends acted like it wasn't a big deal. Never said goodbye to me, or attempted to contact me. I never heard from them again. This made me develop severe abandonment issues that I'm still dealing with today. I guess I deserve it, karma and all.

I can't change the past. I don't even really blame myself because I didn't understand what was happening. But I wish I could meet her and say to her that I'm sorry that I abandoned her when she needed a friend. I'd tell her I wish that back then I had the knowledge I have now, and still sit with her and laugh together.

Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle  giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day.

At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town.

,confession,"I am a college student and work part-time at a franchise fast-food chain that is known for being a tourist attraction. The restaurant has an arcade upstairs that is poorly managed and I am one of the few people that know how to work the arcade. My job was to help the customers purchase cards from the kiosk and handle the prize redemption process. Customers had the choice to purchase either a “credit“ card or a “time” card. The “credit” card allowed the customers to play the games until they ran out of credit and once they were done playing they could go and redeem their prizes with me, while the “time” card only let them play the games for a certain amount of time (no tickets were provided with them).

Anyways, I have access to make the “credit” cards on the computer, and a lot of times people would pass right by the kiosks and come straight to me to try and purchase a card. When that happens, I would always direct them to a kiosk to help them purchase a card. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was lose my $8/hr paying job, so I never even considered making the cards myself and pocketing the money. That was, until one day, a customer really wanted one of the prizes and didn’t want to spend more money playing the games trying to get tickets for it, so he pleaded to get it for $20 (we don’t sell prizes to customers). After the transaction, I started thinking about how this $20 transaction was equal to me working a little over two hours.

The next day I started thinking how much I really care about getting fired from this job and realized that I didn’t have much fucks to give about it. I proceeded to make 20 different “credit” cards each with a varying amount of credits on it. The prices on the kiosk for a “credit” card were $5 for 30 credits, $10 for 60 credits, and $20 for 140 credits. The most popular one was the $5 card so I made 10 of them, six of the $10 card, and four of the $20 card. On my first day selling, I made $160. I had made a whole week’s paycheck within a day. 

The following times I went to work, I was not as lucky as my first time and only averaged about $70 a day which was still great. This was almost 6 months ago and I stopped after two months because I started to get paranoid. There was literally a fish eye camera watching me do these transactions, but as I said, the arcade was very poorly managed and nobody checked the cameras. No one even bothered checking the system and ask why so many cards were made. To be honest, I don’t even think they knew how to check.

,confession,"Several years ago I was working as a delivery driver at a well known pizza franchise. Being poor and morally devoid I managed to devise a way to steal money without a trace.

The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I'm going?

I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out.

&lt;p&gt;The computer system we used processed cash payments and card payments separately for bookkeeping, and orders could be changed from cash to card even once the order had completed. See where I&amp;#39;m going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply delivered an order, took the cash payment, pocketed it, and then returned to the store and changed the order from cash to card. The store owner knew that theft was occuring, as the books were out each night, however it appeared as if the cash sales were all in order and the card sales were out. &lt;/p&gt;

,confession,"TLDR; I took advantage of a change in deposit law in 2007 during college to profit several thousand dollars.  

Back when I was in college, I worked at a party store to support myself.  We were one of the largest party stores in the area and well known for always having kegs on hand.  I was the night manager and helped with the books on the weekends.  Kegs are made from stainless steel and in 2007 the price of scrap stainless steel was rapidly rising.  It was so bad at one point that bars and restaurants could no longer store their empty kegs outside as they would get stolen and sold for scrap.  I believe at the time a new ½ barrel cost something like $150 to manufacture and was sold with a $10 deposit, but you could take it to a scrap yard and get roughly $30 for the scrap value, thus making back $20.  This started to cause a keg shortage so the state decided to up the deposit from $10 per barrel to $30 per barrel.  The state Liquor Control Commission gave us party stores a notice that this increase was coming a few months in advance... and I saw an opportunity.  

Before my next shift I pulled $100 out of the ATM and was primed and ready to buy as many empty barrels as I could.  When a person would bring an empty keg back to the store to return, I would give them their $10 back, out of my own pocket, and load the empty keg into my car to store at home until the deposit increase happened.   That first shift I “bought” seven empty kegs.  After a month I was over triple digits and lost track of how many empty kegs I had.  We lived in an old Victorian house that was way too big for me and my three roommates.  It was a four bed three bath house with two living rooms and two kitchens and a three car garage.  The landlords somehow only charge us $1200 total per month.  The basement had our laundry area and nothing else, that’s where I stored all my inventory.  

One of the full time managers (non-college student) noticed what I was doing but essentially turned a blind eye to my exploit.  He referred to it as “Seinfeld-esque,” but since I wasn’t doing anything to hurt the business or explicitly illegal, I was allowed to continue.  My roommates were equally unconcerned as they never had to deal with the empty kegs being in the way of anything, although they did question my judgment.  I sank every spare dollar I had into buying as many kegs as possible.  

When the day came, and the deposit increased to $30/keg, I was ready to reap what I had sown.  Every shift, I would load up three empty kegs and collect my $90 in cash.  I was limited to three returns per day, due to the store policy, which I may have contributed to.  It took me months to clear my inventory.  Since it dragged out so long in returning all the kegs, I’m not positive about how much I profited, but it was over $5000, which is minimum 250 kegs (and a $2500 investment).  With this windfall I was able to finish my college degree without accruing any additional debt through student loans.  I wasn’t exactly a broke college student, but I had been paying my way thru college and going to school part time while working full time.
