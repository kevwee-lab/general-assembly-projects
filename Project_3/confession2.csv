I am sick and tired and disgusted of anyone who would seriously call themselves a
""problematic-shipper."" Or ""pro-shipper.""

These dense motherfuckers have the gall to say things along the lines like ""if you aren't a problematic-shipper you're pretty fuckin weird."" When PROBLEMATIC is LITERALLY in the title you gave to yourself, shithead.

You only ever want to talk about shit like

• ""is it okay to sexualize children, toddlers, and infants if they're fake?""

No.

•""Japan is better than U.S. bc they have a lower age of consent.""

You're a fucking creep.

•""She just looks like a child, she's actually 900 years old!""

But she still looks like and talks like a fucking child, dude.

•""Fiction doesn't effect reality.""

Read literally any fictional book from any time period and tell me that shit again directly to my face. The fact that 1984 is brought up on a daily basis, the fact that we think carrots are good for our eyesight based on ww2 propaganda, the fact that words and art have more power over people than you think, they all disprove this statement.

•""It's just a drawing bro she's 2d calm down.""

And you stink so bad I can smell you through my screen. I admire how much one handed strawman typing you can do though, props to that.

You motherfuckers have literally cum-brained yourselves on child pornography and mental gymnastics. Please, for the love of God, get off the internet, take a shower, and get yourself castrated.

Edit: adding this since some of you nasty motherfuckers really want to fuck around and find out.

Fiction does effect reality, maybe not in the way you think and maybe not in the same severity for everyone, but it most certainly fucking does.

I'm fucking furious about it. I'm a 27 year old female who lives less than a mile from where this happened. The whole area is, of course, shaken. We're angry, naturally. But what I'm most angry about is the response I've seen on social media.

I'm angry that women are being told not to go out at night. That we're being told to stay vigilent and stay inside if it's dark. Why? Why the fuck are WOMEN being told to change our routine? Why are WE being advised to follow a curfew? Why do we constantly have to live in fucking FEAR of shit like this happening when we literally just want to WALK?

I've been in tears over this and I know that some people will find it dramatic, but I'm so, so frustrated. The comments on the Facebook news posts of men saying that she shouldn't have been walking; that she should have used common sense and gotten a cab. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

I've been in that position. Back in 2016, I made the decision to walk home from work because I didn't have money for a cab. I calculated the route. I had to weigh up the dangers of one route compared to the other. I took the route that I deemed to be safest and yet some fucking asshole decided to attack me anyway. Ran up behind me, grabbed me and pulled me into a bush. The safest route. The well lit route, and it still happened.

Women are so fucking tired. We hate that we have to change OUR routines. We walk with keys between our fingers. We don't listen to music. We don't go jogging after dark. I'm not scared, because I refuse to be. I refuse to live in fear of men, but I am so fucking angry.

And the fucking hashtag. The fact that #notallmen is trending higher than #saraheverard. This is the same crowd that scream 'All Lives Matter' in respond to the BLM movement. FUCK OFF. FUCK OFF. FUCK OFF.

Just leave us the fuck alone. Let us live our damn lives. We are TIRED of living in fear. We are TIRED of being told what we can and can't do. We're so fucking TIRED.

Rest in peace, Sarah. I didn't know you, but we're hurting. You were failed by the very people who were there to protect and we're going to fight for you, and every woman like you.

,rant,"Just heard, for the millionth time, someone say that they hate kids. I don't hate ""kids"". I hate my 9-year-old cousin cause he's a spoilt asshole, but he's not representative of all kids. I must admit that seeing kids in a waiting room for instance gives me anxiety, cause I'm like a magnet for them and they tend to come talk to me or ask me to play with them and I'm an awkward, introverted guy who wouldn't naturally be able to pull off that interaction. That being said, I think most kids that approached me were absolutely adorable. Some of them were tiny little girls with big heads and pigtails and they would want to show me how high they could jump or some drawing they're really proud of. 

Why is saying that you hate kids a thing? You're bound to hear it as people express it openly but I liken it to racism and sexism. You're being hateful toward a general group. The only difference is that it's less discriminatory since everyone is a kid at one point. Instead of saying you hate spoilt, undisciplined assholes with a false sense of entitlement (my little cousin, whom I confirm once more that I hate), you're generalising and saying that all kids are like that. They're not. 

My brother's friend has a small daughter whose father is no longer around. The girl is crazy happy when my brother goes to their house and is all smiles and laughter and energy as soon as he walks through the door. She even pulled the sweetest little prank on him once where she put glitter in his shoes when he wasn't looking. Such a sweet little girl and it breaks my heart when I remember that her father wants nothing to do with her. I wonder if it breaks her heart, as well.

Due to that behaviour of her, I blocked her and the ways have been parted.

     When It came to sex, and the clothes were removed, DANGGGGG! I was scared, everything happened so fast. I got utterly confused and panicked and asked her what the fuck is that. Do you know what she said ? “I thought you had a thing for dicks” Like wtf dude? What made her think that?

        I didn’t want to make her feel embarrassed so we stopped right there, had lunch together and she went back to her home. Then she called me a sexist at phone because I couldn’t have sexual intercourse with her just because she was a transgender and I told her that she should have told me before that she was a transgender . Due to that behaviour of her, I blocked her and the ways have been parted. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the reason she was stopping me from bringing condoms.  &lt;/p&gt;

Among all the positive responses about what’s happened there have been a few bad eggs who just aren’t getting it. I’ll never go as far as saying that *all*  men are the problem, however all men need to do more. 

I was first sexually assaulted when I was 12 in a carpet shop, this was my first sexual experience and when I told people about it no one believed me. My mind not being fully developed then I assumed that this was a normal part of life and this became a recurring theme in a lot of the situations I ended up in. 

When I was 15 I sent private pictures to my then boyfriend who was 15, we had been together for over a year and I trusted him with all my heart. He showed them to his mates at school and sent them around in a group chat. When I was 16 I passed out at a party and whilst I was sleeping a boy who I had just met tried to put his hands down my pants. I was lucky to have amazing friends who saw what was happening and got me out of the room but the boy got away with it completely, and even told me the way I was laid down was “provocative”. 

When I was in 17 the boy in my class at school would try to put his hand between my thighs and get me in the classroom alone with him and I think what hurt the most about this one is that a lot of people witnessed it and no one ever called it out. He apologised to me quite recently, but then his apology was followed by a request to sleep with him. When I was 19 I was spiked whilst waiting for my boyfriend to finish work and was having a drink at the bar he worked at. I went to the toilet and when I came back a man came up behind me asking me “what are you doing later?”. When I told him my boyfriend was the bartender, he quickly left the bar. I passed out and don’t remember anything after that. 

5 months later I was spiked again on holiday as my boyfriend went to get cash out; he was gone for 5 minutes. I went missing for 8 hours. I don’t remember anything apart from stumbling through the streets trying to get back to my apartment. When I was 21, I started a new job abroad and within a week of being there, one of the managers preyed on me and made me feel that if I denied his advances, I could potentially lose my job. Luckily, people picked up on it within a month and it got sorted, however it meant that every night I went out on I was unable to speak to any boy as he would be lurking in the background claiming he owned me. 

When I was 22 I moved to a new city and started a new job which I thought would be a fresh start, only to be groped by one of my colleagues on the first night out and then having all the men at work joke about how he wanted to rape me. I got upset as it just brought back all the triggers I’d looked to avoid dealing with in my life.

I’m 23 now and this time in lockdown has been the longest I’ve ever gone without being harassed or disturbed by a man since I was 12 years old. I, like many women I know, am terrified of things opening up again. Absolutely terrified at the thought of men and their mates being drunk and ruining my idea of a good night.  Terrified of being spiked. Terrified of being groped in a crowd. 

But my story is a fraction of what a lot of women have been through and I also know that if you asked any woman about their experience their story would bear so many similarities to mine.

They like to rent a huge van and have everyone ride up in one vehicle as well. This means that wherever they decide to go, everyone goes. We get to the resort, divide the rooms, and head over to get our ski rentals. By the time all this is over it’s about 8:45 pm and the only restaurant open closes at nine. As we’re trying to load up in the van, people keep dropping their skis, losing phones, just doing anything and everything to waste time. By the time we get to this restaurant it’s 9:10 and I’m stressed. Apparently this entire family has no respect for minimum wage workers and just sits down and asks for some menus.

He and I are both texting trying to figure out how to make it up to this poor girl and decide on a $30 tip, pre-bussing our table before we leave, and a sincere apology as we’re headed out.

No. Apparently the entitlement goes beyond eating after closing and leaving the table an absolute mess, they don’t feel the need to leave a tip either.

No Mr. Potato head was not cancelled. The own company Hasbro was going to combine the Mr. And mrs potato head into one box to streamline their production. You can still buy it.

She is 35.

That's right she still hasn't learned.

She never shuts up. Ever. Like the only silence you hear is when she pauses.

She follows you while she talks too. So when you walk away to escape, she's right there, just **yak-yak-yaking** trailing behind. 

You can tell her you're busy and she'll just keep going. I usually have to start making a phone call so I can talk to someone else just to get her to go away for 5 seconds. Soon as she realizes people are not talking here she goes about herself / her life again.

About how her kid is a savant bc he is 9 and tied his shoes. Or bc he asked a question at school. Or because he dribbled a basketball. Like good for him, I really mean that, but literally nobody cares we are here to do our job not listen to her blabbing on and on about basic shit any kid can do.

Or about how her husband is so fantastic and she's the luckiest girl and everyone is jealous, bc he works 1-2 days a week (he doesn't know how to listen to direction so he gets fired from every job he gets, he is 37 like ffs grow up! I would hope he can work a day or two a week! Like I would never stay with someone who can't hold a job and sits home wanking all day every day while I bust my ass to support him and our child. Lol fuck that!)

Also carries on how she is so great and everyone is jealous of her when literally the only thing we want is for her to stfu and stop talking about herself.

Like I am pretty sure she has no friends and that's why she talks at everyone 24/7. Which is sad but not my fucking job to be her confession booth all day every day when I'm trying to do my damn job!

Like i just want her to stfu and to understand that literally nobody cares! At all!

I want to tell her: You're really not that special that we all want to hear about every detail of your life and every opinion you have!!! Stfu for **FIVE MINUTES** before I kill myself!

I have worked for the same company for almost two years and still noone have had time to introduce me to new work stuff

Since noone had time to help me I tried to read up on stuff on my own but no, I wasn't allowed to do that because they wanted me to get a propper introduction. Also when everyone was away I tried my best to help with smaller stuff, when the others came back I got told to back off and don't touch anything unless they told me to. Again not because I did anything wrong, but because they want me to get a propper introduction and because they were afraid that I would take on stuff that was too complicated for me

During these two years 3 new people have started that have gotten this introduction. Two of them I wasn't allowed to jump on the training because they had much more background knowlage then I did, the third one I simply couldn't keep up with that and my other work load. I also have 0 connection with the team I belong to because we do such different things and therefore have no reason to talk to each other. I also sit in a different part of the building. Even when they eat dinner they don't ask me to join. And trust me, I have tried to tell them 

Now I finally got told that a guy in the team is going to help me by having me tail him. Today was supposed to be the first day and all that happened is that he send me alot of email conversations that I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with or what they mean. I tried to send him a message asking him how he wants to do this, my partner saw that message and started to say that I shouldn't write in that way because it layed all the pressure on the College. But I'm not allowed to do anything and I'm completely free, then ofc it's the college that should decide how we should do it???

The response I got was ""I'm busy, not now""

Every time I bring this up with my partner, either because I'm upset or because I'm annoyed he says: well you have to take initiative, you have to let that stuff when they told you not to do anything go, you can't say it like that, you should ask of you could help with anything etc etc

And I do, every fucking meeting I say that I'm free, I have time if they need me, I'm happy to help aaaand nothing

Last time I got something to do this way was to label some products. In other words print something they send me, take the label and put it on the correct thing. I have studied for over 5 years and I his is something a 10yo could easily do

I just feel so pointless and put in a corner. Everyone else is super stressed and I have about 30% workload but they don't trust me to do anything and my partner gets annoyed when I'm stressed because I don't know what to do and he then tells me all the stuff I did wrong when I spoke to my boss or my college or my parents or how I should behave etc etc

I know I'm not the most social competent person out there, I have social anxiety and are s bit weird. But I'm not THAT weird?! I mean, I manage to handle my own costumers and contacts without any problem whatsoever. Its just that this part has because such a big ""we don't want you"" sign and constantly being told no. I feel like a lost puppy noone wants. I try to let it go but everything I try to offer it feels like they find it more annoying but if I don't my boss is going to find me lazy

Why can't people just say ""I'm thankful that you want to help but not right now"" or for my bf to just give one ONE small compliment every now and then so I don't feel like such a looser instead of picking at everything I say. I tell him everyday that I love him and that I believe in him but the only regular thing that I remember him saying is ""I don't trust you when it comes to knowing the way"" since I can get lost trying to take a different way to the supermarket 15 minutes from us. I spent last week sleeping in our car because of corona and that I had to be at the office early (I live far away from the office). Did anyone say anything about that? No

Why it is so fucking hard to just be acknowledged and to just have somone say that I'm not a looser? Not even my parents tell me I'm doing good, no the last time they told me was that I should have tried to bargain when I bought my last car and that I should loose some weight (I'm on the verge of being overweight because I stress eat now during Covid)

Almost every single time I post anything, not just on Reddit, but on any other site that relates to this, inevitably, there is always somebody, or more usually a group of people that always say the same thing. ""Oh, those times? What, do you hate black people? Do you hate gay people? Do you not like that women have rights?"" ....Excuse me, the fuck?! So, if I like those times and would rather live in them over now, I must be a horrible human being? I must be a racist, a homophobe, a misogynist, no other explanation?

No, fuck that shit, man. I don't hate anyone. Nor do I have any irrational fear of anyone, which is the subtext for having a phobia. I simply don't like the modern world. I don't like the technology jammed down everyone's throats, demanding that everyone join the herd and buy the same shit and like the same stuff. I don't like sentiments, and I feel fucking miserable in the 21st Century if you must know. I relate more to the things from those two decades, the music, the movies, the t.v. shows, the celebrities, the cars, the technology, the culture. 

Literally, the only thing I really give a shit about modern wise now is the coming life extension and age reversal technologies, and even then, I'm only interested so I can reverse my physical age to about 21, 22, and then go back to those times to live a full life.

I am fucking selfish about this, and I don't really give a damn what your opinion on that is.

But fuck right off if you're first instinct is to insult me for it.

When I struggled with the guilt of having stayed with more than one ex after they became physically and sexually abusive during my teens, this song helped me understand what happened.

,rant,"Europeans love to mock Americans about their usage of Fahrenheit, miles, inches, etc. And I get it; they're right. But I feel like it's time for them to accept that the measurement system they use in recipes and for food is completely ridiculous.

I'm an American expat in Western Europe, so when I google recipes, they like to show me recipes from BBC Food. Here's what a recipe on BBC Food looks like:

* 283 grams of white flour
* 37 grams of baking soda
* 709 ml of water
* 12 grams of cinnamon powder

??? How the fuck am I supposed to know how many grams there are? That's right, I have to pull out a kitchen scale, which I never even owned before moving to Europe, and meticulously weigh each of the ingredients except for the liquids, which I need to buy special ml measuring containers for. 

AND, because of this ridiculous measurement system, the nutrition facts on food labels are completely useless. They don't use serving sizes measurements and everything is still measured in grams. Without a serving size, it's a huge pain in the ass to figure out how many calories are in something. And this is made even more difficult by telling me the nutrition facts ""per 100g"" - this is literally meaningless, since 100g of oil and 100g of flour are completely different sizes, so people can't even guesstimate the amount.

When I rant to Europeans about it (yes, I have), they get so fucking confused - ""Cup measurement is silly, cups aren't all the same size!""

But I feel like it&amp;#39;s time for them to accept that the measurement system they use in recipes and for food is completely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an American expat in Western Europe, so when I google recipes, they like to show me recipes from BBC Food. Here&amp;#39;s what a recipe on BBC Food looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;283 grams of white flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37 grams of baking soda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;709 ml of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 grams of cinnamon powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;??? How the fuck am I supposed to know how many grams there are? That&amp;#39;s right, I have to pull out a kitchen scale, which I never even owned before moving to Europe, and meticulously weigh each of the ingredients except for the liquids, which I need to buy special ml measuring containers for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND, because of this ridiculous measurement system, the nutrition facts on food labels are completely useless. They don&amp;#39;t use serving sizes measurements and everything is still measured in grams. Without a serving size, it&amp;#39;s a huge pain in the ass to figure out how many calories are in something. And this is made even more difficult by telling me the nutrition facts &amp;quot;per 100g&amp;quot; - this is literally meaningless, since 100g of oil and 100g of flour are completely different sizes, so people can&amp;#39;t even guesstimate the amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I rant to Europeans about it (yes, I have), they get so fucking confused - &amp;quot;Cup measurement is silly, cups aren&amp;#39;t all the same size!&amp;quot; Jesus christ, a cup is a standard unit of measurement, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can use any ole cup.

&lt;p&gt;Skyrim, CRASHES &amp;amp; oh hey I am a Vampire for no reason &amp;amp; every main quest is closed off to me I can’t complete the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallout 1, the game engine literally times out when you run out of time to get the water chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallout 3 CRASHES! Games for Windows Live required! Compatibility &amp;amp; stutter issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Vegas major crashes &amp;amp; glitches on launch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet now everyone decides to complain, including me, I am an idiot, &amp;amp; the people who did this are idiots too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also to all the people who are like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SONIC ADVENTURE 1 HAS GLITCHES! (minor glitches that don’t effect gameplay) SA1 IS WURST GEAM EVAR!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proceeds to give 10/10 to Fallout 4 on launch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, fuck you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in all technicalities, ALIEN: Colonial Marines has less gameplay issues &amp;amp; critiques than the ones for Fallout 4, but everyone gave that game 10/10 &amp;amp; went on the hatebandwagon for Colonial Marines all because some random Mexican told them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

I hand sanitized to the point of bloody knuckles.  I never went off campus except for necessities or food, which was all delivered to my car or to-go.

A resident of mine who I share a bathroom with went out frequently.  Thrifting, going to cafes, shopping with friends for fun items and not utilizing the drive up options, going off campus to visit family and outside friends, going to parties on campus, etc.

She got covid and is now free from isolation after 10 days.  I somehow got it from her and just now got symptoms.

I cannot go home for spring break anymore and I now cannot see my family until July.  My dogs are old and one is sick, this spring break was one of the last times I could have seen them.

I was going to drive home and test immediately before and after getting there so it was as safe as possible.

I’m now stuck, alone, in a dorm with covid for the next two weeks.  My spring break is gone.  I’m so sick I can’t go more than an hour without sleeping.  It’s the end of the term for my classes, so I can’t even get extensions without applying for incompletes in my classes, yet I also can’t do any of my school work right now.  My grades are plummeting and I can’t do any exams or large papers.

I cannot smell, taste, eat, breathe right, or do virtually anything.

I have a minor heart issue and already struggled with fatigue and I am horrified of long term effects.

I’m so so angry.  I’m so angry that one person’s choices effect me like this and she gets to go home for break as if nothing happened.

This is making me incredibly bitter at things I shouldn’t be and I’m made at myself for being so jealous.  I get filled with so much sadness and anger when I see people posting about getting the vaccine, which is virtually my entire social media feed now.  I get angry at them because I knew many of them to have partied and not follow any safety precautions this entire pandemic, yet they made it to the vaccine before me and get to walk away unscathed.  They get to see their families for spring break and they don’t get to have any long term effects.

I’m also just so so sad when I see news about vaccine rollout.  It’s not a good sad, because I would’ve been happy about this a week ago.  But now I am just filled with sadness that I was SO close to making it and that all of my efforts to protect myself were about to pay off, but now it doesn’t even matter in terms of preventing myself from getting covid.  Obviously it’ll help herd immunity and everything get to normal and whatnot, but I was most excited to know that the vaccine would mean I wouldn’t get the virus and its long term effects.

I also feel incredibly guilty knowing that I could’ve infected others before I went into isolation.

I just feel gross knowing that this horrid virus lives inside of me now and will be there forever.  I feel so upset that the people who didn’t make an effort to protect themselves and others are the ones who did not get it.

,rant,"My birth parents were incredibly abusive people who chose drugs and stupid shit over being functional adults. I cut them off as a teenager and left for the military at 18, haven't spoken to them since. I'm now out, married, and planning an out of state move with my husband in the near future. Life has been good because I worked my ass off to make it that way, but there are still huge drawbacks. 

One example is all the people I see who are able to ask their parents for advice, help with cars, maybe even some financial assistance if needed. I can't do that. My stepdad was an amazing father but he died when I was 10 and I don't have any family that I can ever ask for help. Car is making a weird sound? Better Google it and ask around coworkers/in-laws. Same thing with literally any advice I may need while navigating adulthood. It's fucking lonely and I hate it. 

Not only that, navigating life and marriage while having spent years in therapy for my childhood trauma and only just now being able to get treatment for my ADHD is so fucking stressful. We lost our insurance growing up because my mom couldn't hold a good job for long due to her shitty behavior, same when I went to live with my dad. So I never got the help I needed with them, instead helping THEM because they couldn't cope with responsibility.

I get so jealous when I see people around me having good relationships with their parents, and not having to fight through trauma the way I do. It's exhausting and stressful as all hell, I just want a break from all of it.

,rant,"We need to take covid seriously even if our rich, fully vaccinated leaders won’t. I don’t care if you think masks and distancing are about “freedom”. It’s not. And it’s selfish and stupid to think it is. 

I spent this past year being as careful as I could be without losing my mind. Spent a lot of it unemployed because the money wasn’t worth the risk until I couldn’t hold off and I had to find a job. I was dependent on someone else’s money for most of this year until i could take it anymore. (The only jobs i qualify for aré service industry so fuck me, right? Thanks mom and dad for homeschooling me to the point where college is nearly impossible for me.)This new job happened to be in a bar that wasn’t enforcing any health standards for covid. I chose to only work slow days to lower my chances of catching the virus. However, I was planning on sitting the owner down and talking with him about not feeling safe without having any safety measures in place. 

I caught covid on my very first full shift last week. 

And I’m here to tell you it’s not fucking worth it. 

I’ve been saying for a year that it’s real, reading through every study, sharing that information, correcting people’s conspiracy theories and idiotic facebook memes. We’ve had a YEAR OF INFORMATION. How can people still be so completely misinformed? I’m out of patience. I’ve been hurt by someone along the line of transmission who didn’t care and the people around me have been hurt, too. I’ve been so calm, civil, and just tried to put myself in the other persons shoes and nicely try to get them to read the facts.

But screw it. 

How the fuck can anyone look at one opinion that best case scenario would save lives versus the other which best case scenario spreads an illness to every living person and decide the latter is better? Explain that to every service industry member or essential worker who had to go into work and expose themselves to people who were too selfish to take steps to not spread a novel coronavirus. 

How hard is it to wear a mask? How much worse is it to wear a mask than to just not be the possible reason someone wakes up gasping for breath every night or dies alone because they didn’t have the luxury to stay home?

I’m lying in bed feeling like I have a pillow against my face no matter what I do. Every few breaths is a gasp. I’m dreading the lasting issues I’ll very likely have to deal with. I’m too tired to even get up and make myself food. I’m plunging into the negatives financially because I can’t go to work right now. I gave this virus to my partner who was supposed to get the vaccine last week but by chance it ended up postponed. I passed this virus to someone who could’ve given it to their premature daughter in the hospital. Who knows who I could’ve met at work who could end up hospitalized or die. 

Sure, someone could’ve been asymptomatic but someone else up that line wasn’t. Someone felt sick and didn’t think it was a big deal to get tested or limit who they met so they could tell them all to quarantine. Don’t assume your coughing or migraine isn’t covid. Get a damn test done. Be an adult and take this shit seriously. No worker deserves to get covid because they couldn’t stay home from working and you just had to have your expensive beer in public while you had the sniffles. 

I’m so fucking angry at our asinine leadership that aided conspiracy theorists and convinced their fans that awareness was “fear mongering” and for “bleeding heart liberals”. 529000 people are dead but I guess not wanting your own people to die is unpatriotic.

And i wish i had more female friends because people talk shut because all my female friends are “too ghetto or masculine” and i’m “probably sleeping around with my guy friends” even though i have a bf. And i’m pissed
Like i’m sorry i can make fiends with dudes easily, i grew up with 4 boys who were like my brothers and i hung out with them the most. So i copy what they do and idk :(&lt;/p&gt;

The problem: his parents did not do their taxes, his father is in jail, and he hasn't lived with them since he moved out at 17 (and before that he didn't really 'live' there if you get my meaning)

she did not KILL her baby. let me stress that. it was a stillborn.

HOWEVER the most disgusting part of her case is how her parents acted. they were absolutely appalling. after hearing the texts between skylar and her mother, it was clear that her mother not only knew about the pregnancy, but was more concerned about their family image than anything else. the fact that skylar didn’t tell anyone about her pregnancy up until the day the baby was born, and even two months AFTERWARDS, was astonishing. her mother even GOT AN EMAIL from the ob/gyn by accident, stating the results of her pregnancy test. 

but skylar *somehow* convinced her mom that it was a mistake or something. right. 

parents like skylar’s are the absolute worst humans. for god’s sake, you’re really gonna scare your daughter into giving birth alone in the bathtub and then having to bury her own child because you’re afraid of ruining your FAMILY IMAGE?? it’s sickening. 

i don’t even live in a communicative household. i never tell my dad anything. i know if i were ever pregnant i would be SCREWED. and i know that i don’t want my kids to feel the way i do (if i even have any). no one deserves to have a shitty relationship with their parents. if you can’t even tell your parents how you feel about shit, then you don’t have a “perfect life”, as skylar’s mom so delicately put it as they were *in the interrogation room*. just. god.

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER the most disgusting part of her case is how her parents acted. they were absolutely appalling. after hearing the texts between skylar and her mother, it was clear that her mother not only knew about the pregnancy, but was more concerned about their family image than anything else. the fact that skylar didn’t tell anyone about her pregnancy up until the day the baby was born, and even two months AFTERWARDS, was astonishing. her mother even GOT AN EMAIL from the ob/gyn by accident, stating the results of her pregnancy test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but skylar &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; convinced her mom that it was a mistake or something. right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;parents like skylar’s are the absolute worst humans. for god’s sake, you’re really gonna scare your daughter into giving birth alone in the bathtub and then having to bury her own child because you’re afraid of ruining your FAMILY IMAGE?? it’s sickening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don’t even live in a communicative household. i never tell my dad anything. i know if i were ever pregnant i would be SCREWED. and i know that i don’t want my kids to feel the way i do (if i even have any). no one deserves to have a shitty relationship with their parents. if you can’t even tell your parents how you feel about shit, then you don’t have a “perfect life”, as skylar’s mom so delicately put it as they were &lt;em&gt;in the interrogation room&lt;/em&gt;. just. god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you ever wonder why your kids don’t tell you shit, maybe it’s because you’ve scared them so much that they aren’t comfortable enough to. i know that’s the case with me. and that was definitely the case with skylar. be better.&lt;/p&gt;

People need to take a step back and come to terms with the fact these are collections of hundreds of thousands of people, usually all over the world, coming together to create works of art. I'm sure some developers or investors might be passionate, but these companies are more than one person. They need to make money. In the end that is the main goal.

I also have some weird skin peeling condition that affects my palms and fingers and my palms and fingers alone. It's kinda gross and messy.

They are so skittish and I understand it’s because they are exclusively herbivorous prey animals but these things get scared at every single noise.

She left her elder son in my mother's care, and because her husband doesn't have a stable income they all lived in our house and it's been 10 years. While we were in a different country (long story) she never used to feed the kids, was constantly fighting with her husband, never made the kids sleep and basically left them to struggle unless someone else decided to do something for them (ie I would babysit for hours, every single night for over a year while she would take one kid to make him sleep and take hours) and my parents raised the kids and would buy them food and clothing and whatever they could afford. Now we're back in our home country and she's here with the kids, her husband is in the other country and yet they still fight over things every single day. She doesn't feed the kids, like nothing besides crisps or biscuits, the kids don't know what it is to eat as they've never been fed (they're 6 and 9) and she doesn't make the kids sleep and that's a HUGE PROBLEM because we all have to sleep in one room as our house is really small because my dad's business took a huge blow during covid-19 and all, and I'm about to get a job but the kids don't sleep until 6 freaking am EVERY SINGLE DAY and she is constantly screaming the whole night and no one can sleep and if you tell her anything she starts with her stuff saying she's helpless and the kids don't listen and all. The kids fight the entire day and she is constantly on her phone, nearly 98% of the time that she's awake, and the only time one of the kids stays quiet is if he has a phone and I usually give him mine to stop the fights but it's become so tough that I can't even touch my phone because he's always on it. And she refuses to let her kids touch her phone because 'im using it and I don't want them to have a habit of phones' while she constantly tells him to take mine. I'm so fed up because my mum is screaming the whole day and night and I can't sleep or even talk to anyone. I don't have anywhere to go, no money to move out, no job yet and we're all mentally fucked up and we can't afford therapy.

She left her elder son in my mother&amp;#39;s care, and because her husband doesn&amp;#39;t have a stable income they all lived in our house and it&amp;#39;s been 10 years. While we were in a different country (long story) she never used to feed the kids, was constantly fighting with her husband, never made the kids sleep and basically left them to struggle unless someone else decided to do something for them (ie I would babysit for hours, every single night for over a year while she would take one kid to make him sleep and take hours) and my parents raised the kids and would buy them food and clothing and whatever they could afford. Now we&amp;#39;re back in our home country and she&amp;#39;s here with the kids, her husband is in the other country and yet they still fight over things every single day. She doesn&amp;#39;t feed the kids, like nothing besides crisps or biscuits, the kids don&amp;#39;t know what it is to eat as they&amp;#39;ve never been fed (they&amp;#39;re 6 and 9) and she doesn&amp;#39;t make the kids sleep and that&amp;#39;s a HUGE PROBLEM because we all have to sleep in one room as our house is really small because my dad&amp;#39;s business took a huge blow during covid-19 and all, and I&amp;#39;m about to get a job but the kids don&amp;#39;t sleep until 6 freaking am EVERY SINGLE DAY and she is constantly screaming the whole night and no one can sleep and if you tell her anything she starts with her stuff saying she&amp;#39;s helpless and the kids don&amp;#39;t listen and all. The kids fight the entire day and she is constantly on her phone, nearly 98% of the time that she&amp;#39;s awake, and the only time one of the kids stays quiet is if he has a phone and I usually give him mine to stop the fights but it&amp;#39;s become so tough that I can&amp;#39;t even touch my phone because he&amp;#39;s always on it. And she refuses to let her kids touch her phone because &amp;#39;im using it and I don&amp;#39;t want them to have a habit of phones&amp;#39; while she constantly tells him to take mine. I&amp;#39;m so fed up because my mum is screaming the whole day and night and I can&amp;#39;t sleep or even talk to anyone. I don&amp;#39;t have anywhere to go, no money to move out, no job yet and we&amp;#39;re all mentally fucked up and we can&amp;#39;t afford therapy. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do because it&amp;#39;s 24 hours of non stop chaos and my sister can&amp;#39;t get time off her phone or even make the kids sleep! She wants others to do everything.

Megan generally tends to stay out of the public eye. She doesn’t usually seek out interviews or do publicity stunts. The one time she has an big, highly publicized interview it’s to talk about her experience with racism and that’s being attention hungry? 

_“She’s just trying to bring the monarchy down. I guarantee you the conversation wasn’t that bad.”_

Megan has every right to tell the public about what’s going on. Let’s not forget that Harry was there too and he reiterated the stuff she said. I’m not saying that I 100% believe them but if the royals can’t say “No, we did not say that” or “This was taken out of context” then I don’t exactly have high hopes. 

You were not there. I was not there. You can’t “guarantee” anything. All we have is the word of the people involved. And the other side has yet to actually refute anything that they said. In fact, Megan and Harry purposely did not bring up names because they know what would happen to them if they did.

_”She’s just now realizing that they’re racist? Please, she could have married anyone else. She chose to marry into that family._

Megan married Harry, not his family. Maybe she knew they were racist before-hand, maybe she had no idea it would be that bad. But the fact that she still with Harry even through all of that just proves that she’s there for him and him only. His family should not be that big a factor in their relationship anyway. 

_”People are dying and you’re sitting in your villa talking about racism? C’mon, you’re rich, your not exactly suffering here_”

Megan and Harry are not pretending like their problems are more important than Covid. They have a right to tell people what’s going on with their family, especially if it’s really so bad they chose move. If other people pay more attention to this than more important stuff, that’s on them not H&amp;M. However I can very easily see why people would focus on this more than Covid stuff because after a year of bad news we all need a distraction. 

Also, since when did being being rich mean you can’t face racism?

I will use earbuds for an entire day and only take them off to shower, talk to people and after I&amp;#39;ve fell asleep and I knock them away mid-sleep. On top of that if I don&amp;#39;t have earbuds or headphones on I feel very uncomfortable  it&amp;#39;s simple something I really dislike, one ear has to have audio coming into it constantly if not both depending where I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when people constantly push wireless shitpods on me it drives me up a fucking wall! I don&amp;#39;t WANT to limit my earbuds to a battery life! I don&amp;#39;t want to wait 30 minutes because they died! I want to use them whenever the fuck I want and no have to worry about having the battery! But nobody can understand this basic logic! They just say &amp;quot;I go to the gym every day and they last an entire week before a charge&amp;quot; I use them 20+ hours a day! You use them for 4!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can charge them before going to sleep except that&amp;#39;s not how my sleep schedule works, I sleep when my body knocks me out and that&amp;#39;s between my sub conscious and god so it&amp;#39;s not like I can predict before I knock out and &amp;quot;uh oh&amp;quot; now they aren&amp;#39;t charged.

Look, if you don't like masks, that's fine. I don't like them either. But you still need to wear them. I know people who are refusing to wear masks, and it makes me so furious to hear them complain and whine and moan about how it ""infringes on their rights"" and ""the America they knew is gone."" Are you SERIOUS?! Because you have to wear a cloth mask around your face, you think you're suddenly in Soviet Russia?! Good thing doctors don't share that sentiment, or we'd be screwed medically more than we already are! I'm also happy to know someone's life isn't as important to you as maintaining your luxuries and comforts completely unchanged.

""Oh, but OP, those masks don't work anyway."" I'm sorry, are you a f\*\*\*\*\*\* doctor? Did you go to medical school for years and years studying viruses specifically to help prepare for this sort of event? No? Then shut up. You do not know better. And worse, I feel you already know that, you just use that excuse to not have to wear a mask and hope I buy it.

I had one person tell me COVID wasn't a big deal because they knew someone else who caught it and was asymptomatic. Yeah, no s\*\*\*, there are GOING to be asymptomatic cases, we've KNOWN this since COVID was discovered. That's typical of every disease. But guess what? Not only is COVID asymptomatic when you first catch it (meaning you may not actually be asymptomatic, but pre-symptomatic) but you can spread it EVEN IF IT IS ASYMPTOMATIC!!!

It doesn't stop there. The people who complain about masks and/or refuse to wear them are often the same people who have told me they have no plans on getting vaccinated for COVID. Why? They just don't feel like it. Yeah, not even because they believe those garbage conspiracy theories that vaccines cause autism or change your DNA or anything. They just don't want to get one. And then they say we shouldn't have to wear masks, or social distance, or have any mandates or restrictions whatsoever. A really stupid reasoning I've heard is, ""Well, I got a flu vaccine and still got sick."" Yeah, that can happen. Nothing is 100%. But SOMETHING is better than NOTHING. If you were in an airplane and it started losing altitude, you wouldn't say, ""Oh, I don't want a parachute, there's a chance it won't work."" No, you're gonna take that parachute. So why would you NOT get a vaccine for a disease THAT CAN KILL YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE?!

I'm done with these people. They're selfish, irresponsible, immature, and they treat a disease that has killed over 400,000 in America ALONE and over a million people worldwide like it's a joke. I felt sick to my stomach when I heard my coworkers f\*\*\*\*\*\* LAUGHING over it. You wouldn't joke about people dying from cancer. You wouldn't joke about people dying from diabetes. You wouldn't joke about people dying from SARS. So why is COVID the exception?! How many people have to die before people start taking this disease seriously?! 5 million?! 10 mil.? 20 mil.? 100?! Or maybe they just don't care because they personally have not had to watch someone die from it yet, in pain in the hospital with medical equipment hooked up to them to give them as much time as possible. I haven't had to experience that yet, and my intense desire to avoid it is why I wear a mask. I ask you to have some basic human decency to try and help avoid other people getting sick. Not to mention of how hypocritical it is because about 90% of the people are the same people who accuse Millennials or Gen Z'ers of being the ""Me Generation"" and being lazy and selfish, but the MOMENT their life of comfort and luxury is put in jeopardy, they're up in arms like they're living in North Korea. There are probably a lot of people right now who would LOVE those masks you don't want to wear. They understand the value of keeping themselves and other people safe!

I've been needing to get this off my chest for a while now. I hate having to follow some of the restrictions, but I still do so because I value human life more than comfort. And here's my response to those that have or would call me a ""snowflake-"" first of all, this has nothing to do with politics. It's an ethics issue, not a political one.

,rant,"I work for a warranty company. No, not a company that calls you, trying to scam you into buying a warranty. We’re a *very* popular warranty company, that millions of people use to secure their homes. I work in customer service. Firstly, I was a phone rep, taking calls from angry people that would berate and belittle, cuss me out, etc. Now, I’m a customer service rep for social media. I answer people’s complaints, concerns, or questions on Facebook and Twitter. 

And let me tell you. LET ME TELL YOU. The amount of people that are openly racist, or downright rude as fuck, is horrifying. I didn’t realize how shitty our society had become until I got this job.  

Allow me to provide a few examples of some of the most horrendous;

My first week, a woman was upset because a technician missed their appointment (he was injured and in the hospital from something that happened at another appointment earlier that day), and instead of politely explaining the issue and allowing me to find a new technician, she was screaming. Not just yelling, I mean screaming bloody murder. I was seriously surprised she didn’t lose her voice halfway through. I turned my headset all the way down and still my ears were hurting from her screaming. I eventually took the headset off, laid it down, and could still hear every word she was saying while someone in the background was saying, “Yes girl!!! Tell her!! Tell her!” And clapping. 

Another time on the phone, a few weeks later, I was helping a man get a reimbursement (that he really didn’t deserve by protocol, but I understand and felt for him). I asked him to confirm his card number, and politely explained that we are not permitted to say customer payment information out loud to protect their payment security. He called me worthless. I froze (I’m a domestic abuse survivor who was consistently called worthless by my abuser, and it struck me out of the blue when I was being kind and helpful), and I hung up. I cried after that. I know, I know. It’s stupid, but it just hit me out of nowhere. 

Following that, the rest of my time taking calls was filled with people cussing me out, calling me names, racial slurs, etc. because they were upset with the company (9/10 times though, it was something that was usually their fault, or no ones fault). I had eventually gotten so used to it that a sweet older lady, an English teacher, who called in and ended the call by complimenting me, and telling me I deserved better than this job, made me break down in tears on the phone with her. She was so kind, and ma’am, if you’re reading this, please know I pray for you all the time, and I hope for nothing but blessings for you and your husband. 

Now, on social media, I get to read constant racism. Yay! Not only do people cuss me out then DEMAND a reimbursement (like, you do know that I have control over whether you get the reimbursement, right? And if you’re an asshole towards me, I’m not going to give it to you, or I’ll give you a hard time about getting it), but also say horrible things about our overseas reps accents, about the fact that they’re foreign, or the way their voice sounds, or the fact that they heard an animal in the background (it’s funny sometimes because it’s usually a rooster, but dude, we’re working from home due to covid, and they have roosters where they live for food purposes. Don’t call someone a slur because of where they live). 

It’s just... shocking. We have control over your account, man. I would NEVER do anything to harm my customers, but I can’t say the same for others who work in this company. We have your card information, your address, your full legal name, and so much more. And we have control over how things go for you. Don’t be an asshole. Don’t treat us like shit because we work here. You’re not any better than us. 

Also, allow me to point out that most of our customers are rich, conservative business owners, celebrities, politicians, CEO’s, etc. 

Just... don’t be an ass to customer service people. We are *humans* who simply need this job to support our families. And we’re doing our best, but it doesn’t help to be cussed out and berated all day.


Edit: I just want to add that my crying was not abnormal. Abnormal for me, yes, but not abnormal for anyone who works in customer service at our company. In training, they literally tell us that if we can’t handle being berated, degraded, and cussed out, we need to leave. They told us several times that there will be days where we will be in tears by the end of our shift. They told us it was going to be brutal, and although they hate it for us, that was the job. About 5 or 6 people quit on the first day of taking calls. About 20 by the end of the first week. My coworkers would call me crying their hearts out because of some of the shit people were saying to them.

My 10 yo was rushed for emergency brain surgery. Her 6th. Maybe her 7th...who can keep track they grow up so fast. Always been able to be there, ask the questions &amp; stay overnight before. Now Covid 1 parent rules shut that down. Cool, cool. I knew this before I called my wife at work and told her that she needed to leave the cancer center and do a quick turn around at home to bring her down to the children's hospital. I had already talked to the neurosurgeon on call. She was like, yeah, here's like Disney Fastpass to imaging. See y'all in a few hours. Cool cool. Pack everything up for my daughter and wife, old hat. Not my first emergency trip rodeo. I can be in all rooms at all times grabbing 2x of everything I need for about 4 minutes. It's an X-Men power I have. I can only use it for hospital rodeos.  Everything for 2 girls for 2-3 days in under 500 seconds. Pads, catheters, enema bags, medications, her books, and art supplies, her special rainbow colored build a bear that has been at all the surgeries. More than me now. Cool. Cool. Off they go. Explain best I can to my 7 year old why her her best friend is going to the hospital. Get her to bed finally. Decide to watch coming to america 2..get my mind off stuff while I watch my cell for updates. Oh man. No internet. No houseline. No movie. 40 minutes later on tech support telling me 3 different ways to unplug and replug the powers they tell me my 3 month old modem is broken. Which is 3 dog years and now I guess 300 modem years. Cool. Cool. Cable guy is supposed to come to my house 11-2. No virtual school for my 7 year old. She wants to watch the Prisoner of Azkaban tomorrow morning because her sister thinks the dementors are too scary and refuses to watch it again. The dvd freezes 80 minutes in. Cool, cool. 10 year old is out of surgery, bit more involved than the last couple, but everything is okay dokey. Great. Great. See some internet guys outside talking to each other leaning up against the van, they're 30 minutes early. Cool. Cool. One drives away, huh. I flag the other guy and he tells me they fixed it. Cool. Cool. Evidently the guy who fixed it 2 weeks ago when the neighborhood went out...that guy didn't fix it as good as he lead people to believe. But now these guy who looks like a thumb definitely did. Cool cool. I wonder if my modem is broken like that guy said it definitely was. He saw it from India somehow and told me.the modem is broken, me and that guy spent a lot of unplugging and replugging time together last night. I'm definitely feeling pluggered. Tell my daughter time to sign late for virtual school. Late AF for virtual school. Strange days. Talk to my wife and daughter who's now talking, but sounds hoarse from the breathing tubes. She's having ice cream at 10:30am and thinks it's funny. I know it's for the swelling from the tubes. Wife sounds tired. Asked me to cancel her physical therapy appointments for her herniated disc no problemo. Cool, cool...I can do that from here. You really need a reason, PT clinic? Cool, cool. Emergency brain surgery. Who's at the door? The 11-2 cable guy appointment to fix my modem. Told him some dudes just left after fixing every thing for the block. Rolled his eyes at me. Sorry to communicate with you, maybe communicate with your telecommutions specialist at your telecommunications conglomerate. Cool, cool.
 Play with my dog. He's a good boy. He does exactly what a dog is supposed to do. Talk to them again with dinner updates. Raviolis. She loves raviolis, and is feeling good in the hospital. Raviolis, morphine and Valium is probably better than any Thanksgivings dinner high I can imagine. Good. Good. She's resting.  Hope they drop my wife one. Observation for some hours then the boot. Don't want kids in hospitals too long after brain surgery...they're bound to get sick. Still probably quite a bill for imaging, surgery, picu, jello. Cool. Cool. Wife will be back with her cancer patients on Monday. I got surgery recovery. Been a few years, but I've spent every day with her since she's been born, so I know her. I got this.  Cool. Cool. Gonna eat my feelings tonight. Yup. Appetizers, entree, the drink I like. No guilt delivery for 1. Cook my youngest her allergy dictated meal. Gonna watch Murphy, Hall.,&amp; JEJ and eat my meal when 7yo gets to sleep. 

Drinks weren't what I wanted. No chicken on my chicken parm. Driver said they were out of the 3 cheap 99¢ ice tea, but felt comfortable bringing 1 of the  $3 smaller ice tea in it's stead. When I called them to cry foul on my missing chicken and wanted credit for the ice tea I sent back with the driver, the take out girl that I double confirmed my order with beforehand (I recognized her voice and manners from the previous consecutive delivery mishaps this year and wanted to make sure I was clear) she confirmed she was looking at my beloved brand of ice tea. So the driver lied his fucking lying face to me. He stole my movie night and binge eating. Not cool.   Not cool.  Not cool.  Not cool. This is not cool. This is the line. This is MY fucking Hill. If you are a pizza joint in NJ and you fuck up 3 times in a row and send lying lazy scumbags to my house, you don't deserve to be in business. This is the 3rd fucking time in a row greasy pizza joint fuckheads. You fucking send me whatever. Twice over the last year you've sent me a mushroom pizza instead of plain. Like seriously, what the fuck...you trolling me?  Now it's fucking cheese, sauce, carb wheel of fucking fortune? Fuck you, fucking clowns. Lots of things were said that would be impossible not to take personally. Owner replied with suggestions of self love, because they weren't gonna be sending no chicken my way tonight. Cool cool cool..it's Jersey pal, there's a shitty pizzarias just like yours every 4 blocks. They all deliver. Maybe I'll give them a shot to get an order right...next man up. 
Totally worth it. Fight Club cathartic. Wasn't supposed to feel that good.  Gonna go watch a movie, finally. Unless my modem that I have to rent is unionized and decides clock out and really is fucked. I'm going to call them before Christmas yell at them some more and they'll take it. I'll have them delivery $500 worth of pizza, all different combinations of half side toppings to the local hospital pediatrics department. And one chicken parmesan. Let them dare fuck that order up. You wanna be the ones to fuck up sick kids holiday hospital pizza? I fucking dare you. Totally going to be worth a piece of my Covid relief check.

,rant,"A little background:
I’ve been at my current job for 3 years now, not a long time but it’s seasonal work with high turn over. This year we have 4 people who have been there for that long. Over the years we’ve slowly had more tasks and responsibilities added. My biggest responsibility was training new hirers. We have 2 different sections you can work section A and section B, both are trained completely differently cause they are different jobs. I’ve been the only one who has been cross trained on both since my first year. My job has semi strict deadlines and can’t really push things off.

The rant:
I trained a guy last year on section B and how to check the quality of work being done. It’s his first year, he’s already a lead in section B, and he really doesn’t time manage well. He ran the section B crew last year and there were so many problems that I would spend hours cleaning up after. I’d often put in 12- 14 hour days trying to get everything completed on time. He was out one day last year and I ran section B, my crew was able to leave by 5:30pm instead of their normal time of anywhere between 8 and 10pm. It was a low stress day, my crew got their break, and the people I answer to were happy things were running smoothly.

This year he’s my boss’s assistant which makes him my boss... he’s making changes that don’t actually make a difference other than it’s now more work for the same damn results. The things he’s trying to “fix” are all quality control problems that he created! He’s mentioned a few times about training me to do his old job.....which I trained him on and generally get better feedback from the office staff than him. He thinks that you can type up a 4 page packet and hand it to employees as training instead of actually showing and doing the work with them. He has NO clue what his job actually entails because I’ve been doing it for the last 3 fucking years (I’m including this year because I’m still doing his job while he’s off doing a job not in A or B). This has been the second time (two different companies same manager) my manager has promoted someone into a position where I do a majority of the work.

I just feel like life is so pointless. Grind and grind to work, to barely make enough. Work day in day out to make more money just to spend it to STAY ALIVE and if I'm willing to gamble my future in this pandemic, treat myself a little. THEN FEEL BAD and look for more ways to earn. Work 5 days a week (sometimes more) just to look forward to a few days of rest and relaxation. Is this what life is supposed to be like for the rest of my life? Cuz it’s honestly the worst deal in the history of deals. What’s this all for? When will I be happy? What does it take to feel content? At what point does any of this feel worth it? 

It all feels like a never ending cycle of discontent and emptiness. 
My work holds no meaning to me, yet I overload myself with so much guilt and responsibility it feels overwhelming all the time. Feeling burnt out that some days I honestly just spend the work day staring mindlessly into my screen without getting anything done, feeling paralyzed.

I keep watching that Bo Burnham song - can't handle this, and just cry. I think I watched it more than 15 since in the span of a few days. Just to cry and feel connected to someone who probably feels just as unhappy. As an average person, I felt weirdly connected to someone of that status, who reached that point of having an insane amount of fame and success. 
If he’s not even happy at all that success, fame, money, what about us? All us average people? What do we look forward to? 

We’re all chasing that success, that fame, that wealth, then what? What if I had all that and still felt unhappy? Life feels like a losing game. People suffer, the earth is dying, and us regular people are just working and forcing ourselves to ignore all the calamity happening around us. Looking forward to feeling that tiny tinge of happiness when we buy things and numb ourselves to what’s happening in the world.
If we don't force ourselves into ignorance, we get into a state of paralysis. Life then, truly does feel hopeless. 

Doesn't even matter that the rich get richer. The poor can hardly survive. More and more viral videos or articles showing how poor people are in it worse than before, since the pandemic. We like and share, some of us donate, but what else can we do? What about those who don't get media attention? Are their lives not worth anything, because it couldn't get media coverage? 

People somehow need to make or get themselves famous, JUST TO SURVIVE. What kind of fucked up dystopian shit is that? What's the point in all of this? Why do we keep going? Why am I never happy? 

I'm sorry. my mental state has been absolutely fucked these few weeks, and therapy hasn't been helping.

Is this what life is supposed to be like for the rest of my life? Cuz it’s honestly the worst deal in the history of deals. What’s this all for? When will I be happy? What does it take to feel content? At what point does any of this feel worth it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all feels like a never ending cycle of discontent and emptiness. 
My work holds no meaning to me, yet I overload myself with so much guilt and responsibility it feels overwhelming all the time. Feeling burnt out that some days I honestly just spend the work day staring mindlessly into my screen without getting anything done, feeling paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep watching that Bo Burnham song - can&amp;#39;t handle this, and just cry. I think I watched it more than 15 since in the span of a few days. Just to cry and feel connected to someone who probably feels just as unhappy. As an average person, I felt weirdly connected to someone of that status, who reached that point of having an insane amount of fame and success. 
If he’s not even happy at all that success, fame, money, what about us? All us average people? What do we look forward to? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all chasing that success, that fame, that wealth, then what? What if I had all that and still felt unhappy? Life feels like a losing game. People suffer, the earth is dying, and us regular people are just working and forcing ourselves to ignore all the calamity happening around us. Looking forward to feeling that tiny tinge of happiness when we buy things and numb ourselves to what’s happening in the world.
If we don&amp;#39;t force ourselves into ignorance, we get into a state of paralysis. Life then, truly does feel hopeless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t even matter that the rich get richer. The poor can hardly survive. More and more viral videos or articles showing how poor people are in it worse than before, since the pandemic. We like and share, some of us donate, but what else can we do? What about those who don&amp;#39;t get media attention? Are their lives not worth anything, because it couldn&amp;#39;t get media coverage? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People somehow need to make or get themselves famous, JUST TO SURVIVE. What kind of fucked up dystopian shit is that? What&amp;#39;s the point in all of this? Why do we keep going? Why am I never happy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry. my mental state has been absolutely fucked these few weeks, and therapy hasn&amp;#39;t been helping. Truly close in looking to end things, but I could never bring myself to do it to the people around me and the fear of what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

While I’m nowhere near the point of asking for a manager or abusing staff, I’ve found myself becoming less and less patient with interacting with any sort of service or department. Maybe I’ve just been really unlucky lately but it’s been damn near impossible to get anything done.

Had to send in my speakers for replacement . They didn’t have the model so I had to pick another one. When I picked one a week later I get an email saying saying they don’t have that one. Pick another one, week later they say they don’t have that model and to pick another one. Rinse and repeat two more times until I get a model they actually have and have to pay the difference because it’s more expensive than the original replacement model I wanted.

Every time I order pizza it take almost 2 hours and arrives cold. Which makes no sense considering the place is right down the street. 

Trying to have minor maintenance issues at my campus apartment fixed is like pulling teeth. After submitting multiple tickets with no response. It took two weeks , several phone calls three different people and a specialist just to reseat the Ethernet jack in my room just so I can access my classes. Also it too a week and three more people just to replace the lightbulbs in my kitchen (insert joke here)

Cant get someone in student business services to pick up the phone to answer simple question, but will pick up right away if I say I want to post a payment.

Any and all communication with a company seems to have been relegated to useless chat bots that only ever respond by linking to the FAQ

Looking back now and seeing all the pieces move into place, seeing what kind of person you really were.

The stuff that a father should teach their son that you never bothered to do. I basically was the only father figure to my brother, who has said he has never even felt comfortable enough with you to talk about his own feelings.

The twisted life you have, all the people you've hurt and the promises you've broken and still break, is terrifying. You hurt my mom in so many ways and you act like you're the victim. You manipulate her and her children against her just so you can have an extra day on the weekend with us. How can you expect us, you're children, to see you as the same dad that would take us to the hockey rink early in the morning. My sister will be damaged for life because of you.

I tried to forgive you multiple times now, thinking it was just a matter of mental health, or he was just raised wrong, or he was just plain confused. It is clear to me now that you really only care about controlling people, and leeching off of anyone who once said they loved you. You drain all their energy and self worth, making them feel like less of a person, and that they were always in the wrong.

,rant,"First off, this is NOT an anti-military post, let's get that out there. I just think the current way people talk about ""supporting the troops"" is inherently flawed. Also, this is referring to the USA since that's where I live.

A lot of people I know who use this phrase tend to equate supporting the troops with supporting the conflict they're involved in without question. Asking ""should we even be involved"" seems to mean the same as ""I hate our troops serving overseas right now."" Blindly supporting every conflict not only gives our country a free pass to do whatever they want without accountability, but it also implies that constantly sending American troops overseas to put their lives at risk is somehow a good thing. Wanting them to leave their families to fight and die seems like a preferable situation to the ""support the troops"" crowd than having them home and safe, yet not supporting every single conflict is seen as disrespectful to them.

The above mentality stems from the false notion that everyone who joined did it out of patriotism or blind nationalism, and that's not the case. There's this glorified image of an American troop as being a nationalistic Christian or Jewish conservative who feels a strong need to protect our country. I hate to break it to everyone on here, but there are Muslim troops, troops from Eastern religions, polytheistic troops, and atheist troops, to name a few. There are also troops who are centrists, liberals, libertarians, and full-blown socialists. There are also a multitude of reasons why people join the military. Some join for the education benefits, or because they want to get out of their hometown or a bad home life. Others want to travel. Others would just make more money by enlisting than doing what they were currently doing. People who are told about these ideological differences have often told me that they're not ""real"" troops because they're not truly fighting for our country. Only their idealized version of an American troop is a ""real"" troop. If that's the case, then those people don't actually support the troops, they only support a small minority.

Finally, not all troops are good people. Yes, there are those who put themselves in harm's way to save lives, but there are also those who have done horrible things. There are troops who have been cheated on, robbed, sexually assaulted, bullied, and even murdered, and the culprits have often been other troops. Should we support them simply because they wear the uniform?

So I say, don't support the troops. Rather, support the ones that deserve support, and know what it truly means to support them.",t2_hyntk,False,,1,False,"Don't support ""the troops""",[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_m1oxf5,False,dark,0.92,,public,446,4,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,446,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 2, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1615377941.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, this is NOT an anti-military post, let&amp;#39;s get that out there.

&lt;p&gt;The above mentality stems from the false notion that everyone who joined did it out of patriotism or blind nationalism, and that&amp;#39;s not the case. There&amp;#39;s this glorified image of an American troop as being a nationalistic Christian or Jewish conservative who feels a strong need to protect our country. I hate to break it to everyone on here, but there are Muslim troops, troops from Eastern religions, polytheistic troops, and atheist troops, to name a few. There are also troops who are centrists, liberals, libertarians, and full-blown socialists. There are also a multitude of reasons why people join the military. Some join for the education benefits, or because they want to get out of their hometown or a bad home life. Others want to travel. Others would just make more money by enlisting than doing what they were currently doing. People who are told about these ideological differences have often told me that they&amp;#39;re not &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; troops because they&amp;#39;re not truly fighting for our country. Only their idealized version of an American troop is a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; troop. If that&amp;#39;s the case, then those people don&amp;#39;t actually support the troops, they only support a small minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, not all troops are good people. Yes, there are those who put themselves in harm&amp;#39;s way to save lives, but there are also those who have done horrible things. There are troops who have been cheated on, robbed, sexually assaulted, bullied, and even murdered, and the culprits have often been other troops. Should we support them simply because they wear the uniform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I say, don&amp;#39;t support the troops. Rather, support the ones that deserve support, and know what it truly means to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

In this day and age, when most women are able to be employed and own their own property and want to be considered equal to men, they should be making equal contributions when committing to a relationship. I see a lot of LGBT couples where they both buy each other an engagement ring, and I don't see any reason why hetero relationships shouldn't be the same. 

It makes no sense that in order to prove his love a man has to spend a huge chunk of his salary on a shiny rock, and all the woman has to do is smile prettily and accept it. The decision to get married should be a joint one, and both members of the relationship should be putting in an equal contribution. There is no logical reason that we couldn't say partner 1 buys the engagement rings and partner 2 the wedding rings. Or you buy each others rings, or whatever.

It's just a leftover of an outdated tradition, and the only conceivable reason I can think of for feminists not to challenge it is the same reason none of us were complaining about paying less for car insurance a few years back.

Edit: to be clear I do think that people should do whatever they want, I am not trying to force anyone to do something they are uncomfortable with and while this is my opinion and it will remain unchanged, I am not trying to force people to have the same opinion as me. I don’t believe the statements I made apply to all couples everywhere ever. I know there are other factors and each situation differs.

,rant,"So I just finished watching New Amsterdam, Season 2, Episode 15: Double Blind and the GROSSNESS of one particular storyline in the show really got to me...

**TRIGGER WARNING** the following will involve talking about incest, leave now if you do not want to continue reading. 

So there was this couple who before they met, had no clue whatsoever that they were related. In a town of 80,000 odd people, both of these people got together and as the story progresses we get to know that these two individuals happen to be half brother and half sister, they both had the same sperm donor father. 

As the rest of this all plays out, Doctor Frome one of my favourite characters of the series FORCES INTIMACY from the female patient towards her half-brother and she breaks out crying... She correctly after discovering that her partner was her relation was put off 100% by any kind of touch, look or attention from him, but knew she needed to do SOMETHING to help mitigate their issues together so they went to the Doctor to deal... The whole time, the potential husband (her half-brother) loves her regardless and still wants to get married and Iggy (their therapist) keeps on pushing them into still getting married. He presents them with a DNA chart, saying that they (DNA-wise) match in the same amount of similarities as he does to them, so the fact that they are half-siblings was no big deal, like they could be any two people gettin together so genetically they're no really that terribly THE SAME. EXCUSE ME BUT HAVING THE SAME FATHER MEANS EXACTLY THAT! But they're presented with an argument that nobody had to know nor did they have to explain this to their family so as to not have people's judgements bogging them down with negativity and so forth (I dunno cos maybe THAT'S THE DAMN POINT, however you put it to me incest is wrong, whether you knew before or otherwise and it should never be encouraged, which WAS definitely the case in this episode, GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!) 

*Here's where my personal life comes into play and why I am so angry at this particular part of this show.* 

**AGAIN WARNING FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE TRIGGERED, CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

I was raped by my half-brother. 

90% of this incestuous discussion in the show WAS FOR their continued relationship. I DON'T care how much you love a person and how good of a connection you have, incest IS ALWAYS WRONG!!! 

This couple eventually continued on in their plans to marry one another and that whole theme was washed over with a ""love conquering all"" kind of a feeling... WHAT IN THE HELL!

(1) my time is much better utilized. 

I don’t lose one hour a day going to work and one hour coming back from work. I’ve used those two hours to finish errands at home or do a home workout. 

(2) I save a good amount of money. 

No temptation to spend money on $8 Taco Bell meals to pass the miserable one hour commute home

No spending $3.50 a gallon on fuel to and from work

No tolls to go over bridges- that is $6 a day. 

I live in California so yes these prices are based upon that. 

(3) my health has improved

This comes from the extra time to exercise and this comes from fewer temptations to binge on Taco Bell on rides back. Now I can spend that time to make myself healthier meals at home.

,rant,"I am overweight. Enough to be noticeable. 

I have heard so many people be ""so worried"" for my health that they ""help"" by telling me to off myself, telling me I'm encouraging obesity, telling me that I need to ""just lose weight"".

At 11 years old I got sexually assaulted in a high school and I developed an eating disorder as a result. 

I also have a condition where if I don't eat healthy I will actively bleed out in a matter of hours. My mother has it too and when I was 9 she spent the entire day bleeding internally before finally being taken to the hospital for emergency surgery.

So, my eating disorder was mostly me bingeing on healthy food while also having an active life. 

I went to a weight loss specialist after being relentlessly bullied and after hours of testing, I'm healthier than most people my age (vitamin D deficiency aside) and have zero health risks. 

No one has ever encouraged obesity aside people with a feeding fetish. Everyone is just trying to live a healthy life. Not everyone can afford healthy food, not everyone has a visible health problem.

The people who cry ""stop promoting obesity"" and the ones that are ""worried about your health"" don't actually give a shit. They just see something they don't like and decide to let them know. My existence promotes obesity as much as a naturally slim person's existence promotes anorexia. It doesn't.

People like this are the reason it took so long for healthy weight loss clinics to open up. People like this are the reason we need the body positivity movement, because I had a doctor (unprompted) tell me I didn't deserve a husband because of my weight. They're the reason my doctor chose to address my eating habits before checking for internal bleeding after I got hit by a car.

It's just so frustrating how something as (socially) insignificant as your weight, which doesn't matter unless you're someone's patient, makes people see you as subhuman.

I don’t like the Chimera Ant Arc. The remotely important fights were Gon vs Pitou and Netero vs Meruem (tbh that sucked too). I get that every fanbase is toxic in someway but the Hxh fanbase toxicity is over the ROOF.

I fucking hate how whenever someone says their opinion on it with VALID AND GOOD POINTS, people call them names and act toxic and it’s fine to debate on opinions right? But the people who like the arc don’t even give valid points, they just say shit like “lmao then don’t watch it” or “you don’t deserve to watch good ANIMES” or ""your just an idiot"". LIKE SHUT THE HELL UP OR GIVE A VALID FUCKING REASON! I admit some parts were cool like Killua's godspeed but like...holy shit for an arc that’s like what, 80 something episodes long, there’s only like few scenes that were actually decent.

There was an old thread about someone who said he liked HxH until the Chimera Ant arc and a few of the comments was actually disgusting, especially some asshole who mentioned the OP had to come back after he 'grows up' or whatever... that is an example of the toxicity. And someone even called him a retard. It's shit like THAT, that made me hate the fanbase. The fanbase is full of immature people who act like the show is the best thing since the discovery of sliced bread.

Another thing that annoys the fuck out of me is that the show isn't even that good and people act like their lives will end if someone doesn't like it. Yorknew and the Hunter Exam were MASTEPIECES but the rest of the arcs were boring and lame I fell asleep watching them and switched to Angel Beats.

I always used to think that HxH had a cool fandom but then when I joined reddit, a few posts myself and other people made, proved that that fanbase is the worst. I once expressed my opinion on the CA arc and I got so much hate messages that I had to delete my post. And I find all popular animes have the shittiest fanbases. For fuck's sake, AKAME GA KILL, a lesser known anime, has a nicer fanbase than Naruto and Hxh, animes that are considered legendary.

,rant,"Last night I was carrying my cat to bed since she was (apparently) too tired to do it herself and otherwise would have thrown a fit that would put any human child’s tantrums to shame. 

No joke, she is that bad at times. I have a long, hard, wooden, step stool next to my bed which I walked straight into and hit the top of my foot really bad. 

The pain was bad, very bad. I cursed a few times, hobbling over to the wall to lean against. I must’ve dropped my cat on the hard part of the bed because she let out a yell at the same exact time I hurt my foot. Thankfully she is fine, was just a bit mad at me but otherwise good. So that happened. 

Then this morning I started my monthly Carrie ritual which left me with nearly unbearable pain and I just got back from the endodontist after a root canal. I just got home from the store after getting some ginger ale and pain killers. 

Why in the name of all is good do I have to go through all this at the same time? Just leaving the store my foot started hurting again, I just got out a damn walking boot over a month ago. Why is this happening to me? I’m not the type of woman to have so much self pity but really. Why has the world decided to ruin today?

I'm just an average joe shmo working a 9-5 job, with decent benefits, and a small handful of vacation days. I don't love my job, in fact most days I really hate the content of my job because it's your typical corporate bullshit in which they pretend employees matter but at the end of the day/month/year you are just numbers on a spreadsheet and the threat of termination looms around every corner. Many days I feel like I relate on a spiritual level to Bob in The Incredibles when he's working at that insurance company. (I also happen to work in insurance adjusting, yay.) I've been at this job for years, constantly busting my ass in a highly competitive manner trying to make sure I'm a top performer, taking on every extra responsibility I can, and bending over backwards to help my teammates when they need it. Year after year, I get passed over for the better ratings and promotions for reasons no one can seem to articulate. At best I can lure out some abstract suggestions on becoming ""more of a leader"" or ""making meaningful relationships"" so that my name comes up more. These same folks tell me weekly ""when we talk about \_\_\_ in staff meetings we're always looking at your results as a model for how others should perform"". This constant double standard of ""we talk about you all the time"" but also ""well we don't really talk about you enough"" is a head game that has me a special kind of salty. Meanwhile, ""that other person"" on the team who never volunteers to help, never hits their numbers, but always jumps at the opportunity for water-cooler chat with the bosses gets picked each year for the best ratings and opportunities. I really do not understand how and when the business reality shifted from promoting hard workers with refined skills to promoting cheerleaders and encouraging nepotism.

Every day I see blogs, news articles, Facebook posts, etc. about how ""I left my 9-5 and now I'm living out my dream of \_\_\_\_"". I read all of them trying to gain some sort of insight into how they make it seem so easy, and if it truly were so easy then why is 90% of America stuck working jobs they don't enjoy for middling pay? I'm not much different than a lot of lower middle-class folks these days in that I was raised in a broken home, and thanks to my parents both making poor financial decisions I was not only not offered any assistance towards college, but I also could not apply for loans or financial aid (thanks FAFSA!) because neither parent would voluntarily submit their tax records or income information. Neither of them made much, but both being self employed and struck with a divorce-fueled depression they made some bad calls on keeping up with their taxes. Thus started the catch twenty-two of the American dream for me at age 18: not physically suited for military (bye education assistance), competing for minimum wage jobs at one of the worst economic times (2009), and being pushed out of the house at 18/graduation because that's how my parents were raised (in the 1960s). A few months later, finally managed to find a low paying retail job, and moved into a tiny apartment to split the rent with some friends I made through work. Of course the beater I was using broke down, so needed a new car. Can't exist as an adult without a cell phone. The bills just keep piling on. This was all great motivation to keep working harder, taking on more hours, and looking for the next ""big thing"" that was willing to accept a diploma and a promise to work hard. My financial situation since then has improved, but with every step up came more expenses, more expectations, more stress, and more exhaustion. I would tell myself ""come on man, it's just til you're 25 and then we can finally go back to school without needing your parents' help for FAFSA"". 25 came, and went, and kept going, realizing that once you get in this cycle of servitude it's almost impossible to break free.

At some point I started to come to terms with this being life. I don't really want for many material things, because I can afford to either save up and buy them or put them on a responsible repayment plan. I'd come to accept that things I dreamed of weren't in my cards (fancy car, big house, top of the line gaming computer, giant screen TV with tons of friends to pack around it, lavish vacations to the beach). It's a bit soul crushing, really. With slightly different factors, I probably could have had all that. I was a straight A student, I took AP classes, I made honor roll/honors society. My teachers and siblings always joked about how I'd be ""the next Bill Gates"" because I had an interest in computers since I was wearing pull-ups. But hey, that's life right? Yet somewhere along the line in that blurred transition to adulthood, we start ritualizing deep-dives into the news even when we promise ourselves we'll stop because it's all just depressing bullshit. Every day you flip on the news or scroll past an article and have to hear about the rich and the elite, and the media's attempt at spinning their trivial drama for sympathy. Every day you hear about how some lucky bastard stumbles into a niche market, buys a winning lotto ticket, bets on the right stock, or wins some absurd lawsuit they don't deserve only because the jurors wanted to slap a big corporation. I'm sure a lot of folks see these stories and go ""Damn maybe one day that'll be me!"" For some reason I see these stories and just go ""why even try anymore?"" I'm going to be punching a clock for the next 35 years until retirement, while some folks that get the world handed to them by luck or lineage will never have to earn a dime through hard work again. For me its just a compounding sense of depression in feeling that no matter how hard I work, or how creatively I try to break free from the status quo, I can't see a reality where I will realize my dream of having a job I enjoy with sufficient income to see the world and make the memories I've always wanted.

Well... that's my rant. It's petty, it's pathetic, and it's understandably selfish considering how much worse off so many others are out in the world.

Unfortunately, mental health is a fragile thing and where others will look at my life with envy, I will look at it with dejection as a permanent passenger of my own little struggle bus.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"To all the ""allies"" in the lgbt community asking everyone about pronouns. That shit is honestly a bit disrespectful. I have fought hard for the physical presentation I have and so have many others. It shouldn't be that hard to just treat us like normal people. You shouldn't completely change your behavior towards someone when you find out they're trans even if it's out of respect.

To the bisexuals who say we're ""the best of two worlds"", just stop. Almost every single one of us want to be part of just one ""world"". We don't want to be part of your fetish for women who can penetrate you. You never had a chance with us especially considering we're such a small fraction of society. Your only chance is to abuse a trans prostitute desperate for surgery money.

When I'm dating I'm openly trans and sometimes someone will straight out tell me out of nowhere that they wouldn't date trans people. You do you dude but you didn't have to tell me because I wouldn't date you either since I only date white and attractive guys. I've got a lot of preferences such as I wouldn't date a disabled, short or unsuccessful man either but I don't go around telling them about it every chance I get.

To the alt right guys obsessing over how degenerate we are. Get your fucking priorities right, a socially inept middle aged man going to thailand to bring back a wife is doing way more damage to your sacred ethnostate than any form of ""degeneracy"". Go make your bed or something.

To the people thinking they're clever about mentioning chromosomes. Kids are literally born with 6 fingers sometimes but apparently the brain development is never gonna fail in any capacity right? Endocrine disruption can obviously have an effect on the development of an infant. There are extreme cases of XY (genetically male) people having an almost complete androgen insensitivity. Meaning that their body just doesn't respond to male sex hormones and because of this they literally develop into infertile women (with XY chromosomes). Dr. William Powers have talked about stumbling across such a person. A parent was worried why their mid teenage daughter hadn't gotten her period yet and so they got her tested for a variety of things. Turns out she was genetically male and it was not fun news to give to a seemingly normal teenage girl.

To everyone who is arguing against giving 12-15 year olds puberty blockers and then hate on some trans women for having too masculine features. Fuck you for dooming kids to a lifetime of insecurities and misery. This is essentially what has happened in the UK now. Young trans girls are being denied puberty blockers. Forcing the person likely to have their internal sense of sex hardwired to be female go through male puberty. They will have to fight their whole lives against the masculinization once they finally have a say over their own future meanwhile they are being painted up as villains by the public. The same people that wanted to ""protect"" them from their own decisions now see them as delusional perverts who ruin women's sports and make everyone around them uncomfortable. Just imagine the absurdity of being denied the physical development you want to then be blamed for not having that physical development once it's too late to get it.

The problem is that the director of the musicals is a bastard. He barely tries every year to make things work. I should know, I did the musicals too. He doesn’t care about his students and uses his actual family as an excuse, but his kids are like 15 and 16 and are always off doing their own things. The guy literally teaches one class, and I basically spent my high school years as his crony, I moved on from that though in my senior year cuz I realized it was bullshit. So I just know when he’s not at work doing nothing, he’s just at home doing nothing. In order to get the part you want from him, you have to suck up to him so fucking hard. It’s so annoying.

The time came for them to cast this years musical, auditions came and went, and my girlfriend didn’t even want the lead role in the first place like she literally wanted the 3rd female lead (I.E doesn’t do shit the entire play and literally sings like one verse of a song halfway through). She played the politics game with him, and the part she wanted ended up going to some fucking new girl? I know this sounds like unimportant bullshit, but I’m so mad for my girlfriend right now. When somebody spends their entire middle school and high school career being your little crony and it comes the time for you to hold up your end of the bargain, you fucking do it!

Some extra backstory here in case you think I’m being selfish for her. 1. After last years show went down the shitter due to COVID, there was a conversation between the director and another teacher about how the roles were pretty much precast and that this was going to be “the (blank) and (blank) play.” (My girlfriend being one of those blanks). Second, he said that the list would be put by 9pm on one day, then didn’t get it out until fucking 10pm 2 days later.

The reason is because of one class that has no business being this difficult. A simple history course kids take because they didn't take AP Government in high school is fucking me over so hard just because 50% of its grade consists of pop quizzes.

,rant,"I have an exceptionally sweet and adorable 10 month old ball of joy named Milo. One of his favourite things to do is sit in the window cell every early morning, and I never really liked the fact that he did because it doesn't seem safe but every time I tried to express my concern or close the window my mom always got mad at me and said how I'm too sensitive and paranoid and dramatic.

I've learned to ignore when I have a feeling about something because of how much she convinced me that I'm always just too paranoid. Yesterday morning I woke up and he was sitting in the window cell as usual, my mom was in the room with him so I went to the bathroom. When I came out he was gone so I asked my mom where he is to be sure, she said he jumped back inside the house and probably went to hide somewhere so he could sleep. I had a feeling something wasn't right so I asked her again a while later if she was sure she saw him come in, she said yes.

I had an exam so I took her word for it and went to solve my it while she went to work, after I was done I had classes for another 5 hours. I didn't see him throughout my classes which isn't unusual because he always sleeps through my school day, that's just his normal routine. But as soon as my clases ended I went looking for him and he wasn't in the apartment. Long story short he had fallen out of the window in the morning, and he was dehydrated, bleeding, and scared.

My mom was home by the time I finished school so we gave him a bath and he was barely moving but was awake. I kept telling her to take him to the vet but she once again told me that he was fine and to stop being annoying. Like no mother, he fell down 5 stories and is bleeding. She wiped away the blood that came out of him and still refused to take him to the vet, until he started bleeding again and that's when she decided to consider my begging to take him. (If you're wondering why I couldn't take him myself, I'm 13 so that's not possible.) 

Fast forward to after the vet visit, he broke 2 teeth and slashed his bottom lip open so he's in a lot of pain and won't eat for a few days, his whole body undoubtedly hurts from the force of the fall but thankfully he didn't break any bones. 

The doctor gave him 3 intramuscular shots, which were really painful for him and he screamed the whole time. I'd never heard him scream like that before, it was so heartbreaking to listen to I barely managed to keep it together. He also took this iodine solution thing for his lip, which is really bitter and stings according to his doctor so he also didn't enjoy that and the noises he was making broke my fucking heart.

He'll have to take daily shots and the iodine thing for at least 3 days and he should start feeling better, until then the vet said he'll be sleeping all day and will refuse to eat so we should just make sure he drinks milk and water. So far he only accepts water though.

When we got home my mom kept saying how if we wouldve found him earlier he wouldn't be in as much pain because he hurt his mouth after the fall so it wasn't the main reason. And by ""we"" of course she means me, because she was at work and my older sister was asleep so I was the only one home and awake.

I feel so fucking guilty, I can't stop thinking about how scared he was for those whole 6 hours. He probably thought I abandoned him too. If what my mom says is true and he hurt his mouth after the fall then that's also my fault, he's not eating because of me. He's in so much pain because I didn't find him earlier. 

I feel like a horrible owner, I never let him in the window unless I'm watching him closely to make sure he doesn't step near the edge, and when my mom leaves I take him back inside and close the window because she'd yell at me if I do it around her but I'm not willing to risk his safety.

I know she's the one who was supposed to be watching him as I had just woken up and was getting ready for my exam, but it's my fault for trusting her with him. He wouldn't be in so much pain if I didn't allow her to supervise him. She's literally the most irresponsible person I know I shouldn't have let her watch him. But if I ever try to do even hint that I don't trust her enough to let her watch him she'd practically kill me. I don't know man, I feel so awful and it's eating me up alive. Is it actually my fault? Or who's to blame in this situation.

Update: morning after the fall, he's still very tired but seems to be moving slightly more than yesterday. He still won't accept any food or milk but we're working on it.

,rant,"I consider myself progressive and typically love talking about such topics. I have a couple of friends that are similar, and have similar political stances. One topic I'm passionate about is birth control. Namely BC and contraceptives being widespread and free as the costs incurred would be outclassed by the costs saved on fostercare and similar programs. I would also love for men to have a good option for birth control as well.

Though anytime I see this topic brought up, or I bring it up myself. Someone ALWAYS incorrectly references that study a few years ago about trials on male birth control and they canceled it due to symptoms similar to what we face when taking the pill. That men don't want to take birth control. They always use that to put down men as weaker and not wanting responsibility.

Yet they gloss over the fact that while symptoms were similar, frequency was not. Depression was reported as 23 times more common. Muscular pain was over 300 times more common than the pill. Some testing centers reported 95% mood disorders. There was about a 1/40 chance that the man was sterile for a year with a 1/100 chance they were permanently sterile. Let alone with all of this there was even a suicide. Yet with that, a large majority of them still said they'd continue taking the birth control if the study wasn't canceled. And the trials were canceled by two independent safety committees. One of which was under the World Health Organization.

There is just so much misinformation that was going on with this study that put down men. Even so that the Huffington Post made an apology on their blatant tabloid journalism on the subject.

I have a couple of friends that are similar, and have similar political stances. One topic I&amp;#39;m passionate about is birth control. Namely BC and contraceptives being widespread and free as the costs incurred would be outclassed by the costs saved on fostercare and similar programs. I would also love for men to have a good option for birth control as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though anytime I see this topic brought up, or I bring it up myself. Someone ALWAYS incorrectly references that study a few years ago about trials on male birth control and they canceled it due to symptoms similar to what we face when taking the pill. That men don&amp;#39;t want to take birth control. They always use that to put down men as weaker and not wanting responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they gloss over the fact that while symptoms were similar, frequency was not. Depression was reported as 23 times more common. Muscular pain was over 300 times more common than the pill. Some testing centers reported 95% mood disorders. There was about a 1/40 chance that the man was sterile for a year with a 1/100 chance they were permanently sterile. Let alone with all of this there was even a suicide. Yet with that, a large majority of them still said they&amp;#39;d continue taking the birth control if the study wasn&amp;#39;t canceled. And the trials were canceled by two independent safety committees. One of which was under the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is just so much misinformation that was going on with this study that put down men. Even so that the Huffington Post made an apology on their blatant tabloid journalism on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just utterly pisses me off. Where we should be advocating socially more for men to take more responsibility, and even encouraging them. Clinical trials that were REASONABLY canceled on a male birth control is now still to this day used as a weapon against men in general.

If you have a decent employer, you get a list of supposedly ""great"" insurance options. But you're not allowed to ask which one would be best in your situation to either your HR or to the health insurance company itself, because they don't want you to come back and say hey you led me astray. You're given a pdf of all these plans, which are nearly impossible to fully understand, often telling you ""go to page X to read about Y"", and then on page X it just gives a vague statement. This might be fine for an able-bodied person. After all, you just pay the premium every month and hope you don't end up in the hospital or sick. So you have a deductible on your plan and once you pay that amount, you can finally have benefits begin. The benefits will be great for some things, but completely awful for others. If you have an illness that puts you in the sweet spot of healthy enough to not be on disability checks but sick enough to need life saving medication or treatments, lucky you! You have secured your spot in the second class citizenry - I'm looking at you, type 1 diabetics.

Meanwhile, you can't put money in savings because you spend it all just to survive. And of course this financial pressure makes your chronic illness worse, in addition to mental health struggles, but you can't pay for those problems....And the whole thing has literally murdered thousands of people. But yet, it's just normal. It's not normal. But we accept it as normal.

You&amp;#39;re given a pdf of all these plans, which are nearly impossible to fully understand, often telling you &amp;quot;go to page X to read about Y&amp;quot;, and then on page X it just gives a vague statement. This might be fine for an able-bodied person. After all, you just pay the premium every month and hope you don&amp;#39;t end up in the hospital or sick. So you have a deductible on your plan and once you pay that amount, you can finally have benefits begin. The benefits will be great for some things, but completely awful for others. If you have an illness that puts you in the sweet spot of healthy enough to not be on disability checks but sick enough to need life saving medication or treatments, lucky you! You have secured your spot in the second class citizenry - I&amp;#39;m looking at you, type 1 diabetics. While politicians talk all about insulin prices, which for sure have surged to absoranant measures, they fail to ever talk about the insulin pumps, the syringes, the continuous glucose monitors, the regular monitors, the testing strips, the ketone strips, the lancets, the glucogon or bisqimi, the alcohol swabs, the glucose tablets, any of the related hospital expenses, much less imagine having to take an ambulance ride if you fall off the tight rope just once.....And all of this is to make some people very wealthy. Meanwhile, you can&amp;#39;t put money in savings because you spend it all just to survive. And of course this financial pressure makes your chronic illness worse, in addition to mental health struggles, but you can&amp;#39;t pay for those problems....And the whole thing has literally murdered thousands of people. But yet, it&amp;#39;s just normal. It&amp;#39;s not normal. But we accept it as normal. And so, you decide to take the severe financial penalty of choosing to live every day, while some men or women at the top of the insurance companies and all the intermediary companies buy luxury cars, yachts, mansions. I just hate the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a biracial half Caucasian, half black 18 year old teenager who lives in a not so bad, not so great area in Ontario, Canada. That being said, I hate when people say anything along the lines of, ""Why do I even need to learn this? I'm never gonna use it in my life.""

Let me explain why this phrase is so utterly annoying to hear. Me being a student with about average grades can 100% understand that a lot of the stuff we learn in high school isn't exactly relevant. I get it. *BUT,* that does not mean what you're learning is useless in any way, shape or form. I find that the group who mainly spout this redundant phrase are the students who don't really pay attention but just barely get their work done and see school as more of a social hang out where you occasionally learn rather than a place you learn and occasionally hang out.

A great example I usually present to people is this: ""Say you want to be a History teacher and your friend wants to be a Science teacher. You think science is useless because you'll never need it and your friend thinks the same about History. It would strip opportunities and knowledge from others because you deem it unnecessary."" But I feel like math is a little more understandable with this phrase so let me rant about that. Math is quite literally, one of THE UPMOST important subjects in school. Right there next to Language/English (depending where you're from). ""Oh but but I would NEVER in my life need to know the Pythagorean theorem!!!11!!1!"" Yeah, maybe on the day to day you wouldn't. But what about when you need to. Hm? What then? Then you're gonna wish you did learn it.

Now there's always the argument that someone can just ""google it"" or ""use a calculator"". Now I don't know if I just have some insane superiority complex or whatever it may be but... Do you really just want to be stupid? I don't know about you but I LOVE the idea that I can do semi-complicated maths or sciences on a piece of paper with not much to base it off of but my own knowledge. 

Lastly, I despise when people say anything close to, ""They teach us about \[X\] but don't even bother to teach us about TAXES or INSURANCE or JOBS or any adult things."" Now I'm sorta going to speak from my own experience because I know this sort of thing changes depending where you are but... They do. School literally teaches HOW to do taxes and WHY you need to do them. Personally, it was in ***MATH CLASS.*** We also learned about Insurance in ***MATH CLASS*** and in Civics class. We learned about mortgages and how to get a job and write a resume and our laws and our duties as a resident in our city. Now to some this may sound like a huge surprise because I'm sure a great deal of you have not had the chance to learn these things in school and that sucks.

,rant,"So my life started out pretty good, considering what my future would hold. I had a mother and two grandparents who loved me. But things were never really great, my dad left me and my mom when I was a baby so my mom had to raise me on her own. So she turned to her parents who allowed us to live with them, we from the mountains to the beach so they could start over. My grandfather and my mom worked at the local fire department and my grandmother stayed home to take care of me. But my grandfather had health problems and had to quit his job and my mom quit her job as well because my grandparents became unable to properly watch over me. We were still getting income from my grandfathers checks (he fought in Vietnam).

My mom was dealing with depression which led her to drinking and drugs, unable to control herself she would frequently beat me, one night when I was five she tried to molest me. Over the next two years things at home got worse, we found out that my grandmother had alzheimer's, my mother and grandfather got into verbal and physical fights and my grandmother was constantly berated my mom and grandfather. I felt like my world was falling apart.

On January 26, 2012 my grandfather overdosed in his car in the front yard, my mom left him in that car for the whole day telling me that ""he was fine"". Later that night the police and ambulance showed up. I watched as they opened the car door and he slumped out. I tried comforting my grandmother while barely able to contain my own emotions. Over the next few days my life got worse, my mom started cutting herself again, drinking more and doing more drugs. My grandmother developed depression and I was barely able to function in school (yes, I was still sent to school).

One day that month I came home from school to my mom about to beat my grandmother, I ran over to try to stop her but she just threw me into the wall and walked out of the room. I tried telling my grandmother that everything would be okay but then my mom came back into the room with a knife. She yelled at us, saying that it was our fault that everything was wrong with her life, and as she cut herself she told me that I was the reason she was doing this. I tried pulling the knife out of her hand but she knocked me to the ground. After she was done she walked outside and into the neighborhood. I called my friends mom who then picked me up and took me to their house. She called DSS who visited me in school, they asked me questions but I refused to answer. THe next night they came to my house and had me pack enough clothes for a weekend and took me to live in a family in another county.

That family was nice, they tried getting me to open up (I refused). They had 3 other foster kids but the house was kind of packed. DSS quickly put me on medicine for anxiety and depression. After a week of living with them my last foster family and future adopted parents picked me up. The first couple months were nice there since one of the people from my home town was in the same foster home with me. He left that summer. Then things started going downhill.

My relations with the foster family slowly got worse, over the course of five years they began to resent me. In eighth grade they adopted me ( I agreed since I had friends at the school I went to). \[I'm now skipping to last school year because I don't remember much from the first two years from high school\]

Last school year I met a friend who I'm calling Vance. He was an narcissist, I ignored it for the first...let say six months, where upon he would stab me with pencils, blame me for his problems, and it all ended when quarantine began. I began to feel like commiting suicide which scared me, so I went to Vance for help ( no one else was online). Instead of helping me he told me that if I feel like I should do it then I should. He then went offline for the whole summer never once contacting me or my friends to see if I was ok. So from that day until August my mental state gradually declined. My anxiety and depression got worse than I had ever thought possible and I began trying to cut myself ( I was unable to do it for a while).

I reached out to my friends over discord who tried helping me, When school started back guess who also came back...Vance. He messaged me acting as if nothing had happened. I went off on him and he went offline for a week. He then came back acting as if nothing had happened yet again. I tried prying for answers but I only went in circles.

From September to November my relationship with my family got even worse, they all started ganging up on me for everything (they did this before but never at this rate), which caused my anxiety to increase, I would have panic attacks day to day. Every time that happened no one at home were even remotely concerned. In January Vance came back and this time pretended as if I was trying to ruin his life by making up things to make him feel bad, what would I have to gain from that? So I told him to fuck off, then he blocked me.

He made alt accounts to message me, every one of them he had a different persona. Yes I know what your thinking, and yes, he is insane. In February I started getting ready to apply for colleges but in order for that to happen I would need to do my FASFA. I needed an account and my parent needed an account. So instead of letting me make mine (which is what is supposed to happen)  they take control from me and have their daughter make it for me, incorrectly I may add, and still did not make the parent account.

I needed a state ID and my Social Security card, but my family refused to allow me to get those. (You may be wondering why I have no control of my life, and that is because they never gave me any) I also felt suicidal again and I began cutting.  \[let's skip forward to recently\]

Last week I was going to properly make a FASFA account and have them make one for themselves, so I printed out a sheet with the directions to make one with the important details highlighted. So instead of using the paper to make the parents they yet again make one for me, and yet again it is made wrong. So I made an account for me without telling them, which pissed them off. I asked my adopted mom why she won't make an account for herself and her excuse: ""I don't know how to use a computer"". That excuse makes no sense because she uses her chromebook all the time, she can even make it on her phone which I pointed out. But that only pissed her off.

Me, my college adviser, the school counselor and my therapist are looking for ways to get me into college, so I'm not too worried about that, were also looking into summer programs where I can stay on campus so there's another option. Also I recently found out that my adopted family only kept me around for checks, they also got my stimulus check without me knowing and plan on getting my check from DSS in June. All that info is new to me. I Feel as if I have no one at home to turn to, Imagine how captain america felt in Winter Soldier times ten.

What made me write all this is because I am at a point where I have no idea how I am going to keep going or if I will be able to.

,rant,"So the story kicks off in 2018 when i was about to turn 16 in the summer. I had the privilege of getting a brand new car at 16 so my parents tale me to some dealerships to look. I was really interested in the Camaro’s and Mustang’s at the time (The V6 ones). After already liking the $34,000 options a lot, my dad says we should go look at some dealerships in Orlando. We go to Lexus &amp; Audi and I am EXCITED. Obviously no matter what car I see there it is going to be nice and badass. Even though getting a luxury car for a kid is a horrible idea, absolutely none of them are going to say no. I mean, I didn’t have to pay a dime and I can have a brand new luxury car? YES! So basically to sum that up, I saw a 2018 Audi A5 with all the options and its black on black and I fall in love with it. Couple months later, I am suprised with it on my birthday and I am super excited. I loved it so much and I still love it to this day.

2 1/2 years later.... yikes. My mom never said yes to the financial decision and my dad always kept her out of their finances. They get a divorce because of other marital issues and now me and my siblings live with my mom. I am working full time and I am helping pay rent every month now. The car is still paid for by my dad but the car is a lease :/ So it returns to the dealer in December. My dad doesn’t want to keep it or buy me a new car after (understandable). Now I have to save up and buy my own car this December. Buying a different car is not going to be a problem since i will have a lot saved up. The problem is, every option is a downgrade. When you buy your kid a brand new $54,000 luxury vehicle nothing can compete under $28,000. No matter how hard I can work my ass off this and the car I end up with, EVERYTHING is a downgrade. I felt like i’m going to work so hard for a car just to feel upset about losing what I use to have. Obviously if i had the knowledge I have now, I would have told him to get me a beat ass reliable corolla for $500 to save me the trouble. I wish he would’ve made me work for my first car or at most bought me something cheap. 


At this point in time i’m currently looking back at that mustang I’ve always liked and i’m saving up for it. The funniest thing is, I am more excited THINKING about getting the Mustang by myself than I was getting the Audi on the first day. I am going to feel VERY accomplished at the end of this year :) Even though it might be a downgrade from what I had, it is still a nice vehicle and I will be extremely proud of it.

Name changes can only be done in person. 

Just walk right in during open hours 9am to 4pm. 

We're closed on weekends but we'll only say that on the phone because we're too special to list it on our website next to the address. 

You can't come in because an appointment is needed and only specific people are allowed inside.

Call this number to make an appointment.

This number doesn't do appointments, call this number instead.

You have to call the number you called previously because they deal with cards in your area. 

An appointment isn't needed for a name change, you have to drop off the application at the office drop box which is open from 7 to 1.

There is no drop box here, you need to make an appointment and hand in the application in person. 

There is a drop box but it's open twice a week but was not there during open hours on one of the days it should be there. 

They never had a drop box you have to mail it to a po box whose number can't be found on the internet because the physical address doesn't accept mail. 

The po box isn't available you have to send it to the physical address but the drop box is much faster why not come in Thursday and drop it off.

You were going to the wrong office, you need to go to the one you were going to and drop it off at the drop box it's right there when you walk in, maybe you went too late because somehow 11am is later than 1pm.

Hopefully they get it and actually send back the updated card. I'm so fucking tired. I called the UPS store to ask a question their faq couldn't answer and the automated system said to do online chat since it's faster. I did an online chat and my question was answered right then and there. Yes, I can use my outdated ID to access the mail until I get my updated one with the name on the account. Thank you. I called PayPal to clear up some information because their online chat left me hanging for hours. They answered right then and there. I need the updated photo ID to update my name although the faq doesn't clearly state that. Thank you.

For a government service they're so fucking inaccessible which is stupid because the dmv has all the information one would need on their website. I'm not fucking calling them to ask about something basic like how to do something, there's a whole page detailing everything, including the documents I need. I want to sleep and never wake up again. I'm so fucking tired. 

I just want to be comfortable in my own body and live as myself why does it have to be this difficult? It's a fucking piece of paper.

The court order was same day, the only gripe was getting exactly $12 in cash when the atm only does $15 and the nearby 7-Eleven only had snacks that cost basically $4 and all the other places to buy something cheap from weren't taking cash.

The man taking in the petitions was super helpful and the whole process took about two hours, solely because other people were in line. All the staff at that building were helpful and weren't vague or inconsistent. I just want this to be over so I can finally have a real name and not this stupid shit, and to fully cut ties with my family. They're off the deep end at this point and will not ever change.

Isnt it wierd that if you live in a Refugee camp in yemen you can't start a gofundme for help, but the whole page is full with campaigns about yemen and not much of it arrives here? (saw some colthing and food with charity inprint SOLD in the market)

anyways about my project

I live in a refugee camp turned city in Yemen called Basateen in Aden.

Many Refugee from other countries and displaced People come live here in the street. Most of them are Somalis or People from Ethopia. I want to help them by provide the comunity with acces to computer to write documents to Orginisations, or fill out forms to goverment, Escape reality with movies or contact the family that they are save. Sadly everything is here overpriced and i need some people to support. Not financily if that is too much, but with computers and their equpment for this project. I am willing to answer any question needed, sadly im not always online so the answer might come later.

Also the sad part is, even tho Gofundme has alot of project about Yemen, actual people living here arent alllowed to use their service and this country isnt ""availble"" according to gofundme. Also  reciving money isn't availble over Paypal also. But oddly you are allowed to send.And Banks here can't recive either from countries from outside. Maybe because its sanction from America.

But the American companies western union and moneygram still work. Very odd as if they want to drain and get precentage from the poor people here and cut off any other way for them to get help.

Maybe I’m not moving to New York to be the most attractive there, because I don’t CARE about that. Also honey, you not wanting me in New York doesn’t speak for the entire city. I also got hate comments saying I had teeth like a horse, coffins, crooked teeth. I had a LOT of them. Like people telling me to get braces, and they hope that there are good dentists in New York because I NEED it. Apparently I also have a punchable face?

I already had them, but it was too painful for me to get them on my bottom teeth and so CHILD me simply refused and now it’s too late. Not that that is ANY of their business.

,rant,"Okay I need to rant omg

So, some time ago I posted a cake day Reddit post after celebrating my birthday with a housewarming party and expressed my gratefulness that I started a fully independent life and moved out of home and was excited to see what life has to offer me. Oh, boy was I not prepared for life's gracious offerings. 

Before continuing, I can luckily still keep my apartment and can afford to pay my rent.

Anyways.. about a year, or a little bit more ago, I was visiting a shop, to buy myself some hair care and during that time there was a discount season, and I saved some extra money to treat myself with better hair stuff. I had some extra money left, and I saw a great offer for one toothpaste. It was apparently eco and vegan and everything else friendly and fluoride-free and from sustainable resources, all that fancy stuff. I was interested to try it out. My logic went that way, ""it's discounted, but still costs more than average whitening toothpaste so, it must be good"". It was fine :). I wasn't overly surprised or anything. I liked the mild mint taste I had after brushing my teeth. My old toothpaste was almost empty, so I decided to continue using that fancy af toothpaste. 

Fast forward to December 2020, when I decided to go and check my teeth at the dentist. I never had any suspicious pain or anything. Just a usual check-up.  It's also worth noting that I never had any problems with dental hygiene. I maybe had 1-2 cavities when I had my braces but never nothing serious.

I think you're already figuring out what happened next :D

I didn't figure anything was wrong when my dentist made x-rays of my teeth. That was a normal procedure as I was assigned to a new doctor etc. But I knew I was in trouble when she told me, ""shall we count all the cavities then?"". I was laying down on that dentist chair, and I wanted to sink under the floor at that moment. She pointed and counted out every cavity I had, and I tried to keep my cool but I was shocked. And these were all cavities that needed medical attention. 12. What the hell!? 

That was my first surprise. Before leaving the dentist cabinet she told me, ""the medical bill will be higher than usual, so don't be surprised"". I didn't want to know how much would it be. I was scared to go to the reception. Compared with my current situation, it wasn't that bad. The bill was around 160€

Today I had another visit, and I planned my budget with the assumption that today's visit won't' be that expensive anymore, as I had consultations included in my bill last time. Ha.. The dentist centre changed its price list, and now they have filling prices under one average sum of 50-110€. Did some rough calculations and thought maybe, just maybe, I can do with 170-180 max 200€, for 2 visits this month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember I said that my life was very gracious with its offerings? My bill was 200€ 

&amp;#x200B;

They had a student, with a supervisor in reception and I think they both saw my masked face lose some colour when I heard about the price. I went numb. I even lost my appetite when I was driving back home. And then the realisation hit me. Every visit is going to cost me on average of 200€ because of that fucking toothpaste.  

&amp;#x200B;

It will cost you 10x more to fix your teeth.",t2_5roqmufk,False,,0,False,Fuck fluoride-free toothpaste,[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_m158go,False,dark,0.94,,public,13,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615321080.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay I need to rant omg&lt;/p&gt;

I was laying down on that dentist chair, and I wanted to sink under the floor at that moment. She pointed and counted out every cavity I had, and I tried to keep my cool but I was shocked. And these were all cavities that needed medical attention. 12. What the hell!? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my first surprise. Before leaving the dentist cabinet she told me, &amp;quot;the medical bill will be higher than usual, so don&amp;#39;t be surprised&amp;quot;. I didn&amp;#39;t want to know how much would it be. I was scared to go to the reception. Compared with my current situation, it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. The bill was around 160€&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I had another visit, and I planned my budget with the assumption that today&amp;#39;s visit won&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; be that expensive anymore, as I had consultations included in my bill last time. Ha.. The dentist centre changed its price list, and now they have filling prices under one average sum of 50-110€. Did some rough calculations and thought maybe, just maybe, I can do with 170-180 max 200€, for 2 visits this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember I said that my life was very gracious with its offerings? My bill was 200€ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had a student, with a supervisor in reception and I think they both saw my masked face lose some colour when I heard about the price. I went numb. I even lost my appetite when I was driving back home. And then the realisation hit me. Every visit is going to cost me on average of 200€ because of that fucking toothpaste.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; If possible, don’t use fluoride-free toothpaste. It will cost you 10x more to fix your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"I'm a unique age when it comes to american health care.


I'm 31 and I've ripped 4 teeth out of my own skull over the years out of necessity (luckily they've all been back teeth)

I was an adult already when the aca passed, I was aging out of my parents healthcare (if they had any) when they changed the age to 26.



Dental care in the us isn't considered health care, (neither is vision for that matter) my dad never bought into dental insurance because it didn't really cover anything (it still doesn't, but I digress) and would pay out of pocket for my dental needs as they arose when I was a kid.

by the time 2008 rolled around I had just graduated highschool and my family lost EVERYTHING in the recession, I mean everything, our home included, we lost all of our health insurance too.

There were weeks when the food pantry ran out of food and my dad would go hungry to lend me $10 so I could buy food for the week.

Around this time my wisdom teeth had started coming in and damaging the teeth infront of them.

I didn't qualify for medicaid back then, and I damn well couldn't afford insurance on my own.

I learned how to get animal grade amoxicillin to cure the raging infections that would happen in my teeth as I couldn't afford a dentist or to go to a doctor at all, 

a trip to the er would get me antibiotics with a $2000 bill but no actual dental care, so I'd just return a few months later with a repeat infection because dental care isn't considered essential healthcare in the us so the hospital would throw antibiotics at you and send you in your way.

I once had an infection so bad in a wisdom tooth that the bone above where it once was it became deformed from the infection.

Finally the aca happened, I had a poorly paying job but I'd be damned if I wasn't going to use my paycheck to get health insurance, and I opted for the additional $40 per month dental insurance because holy hell having broken teeth is awful.

My teeth at that point weren't that bad, I just needed my wisdom teeth removed and the teeth infront of them needed minor repairs, I excitedly went to the local dentist office, got my checkup and presented them with my insurance card.

$8700. WITH INSURANCE. I couldn't afford it, I went to a few other places in town and they all quoted me around the same. I was busting my ass making $7.50 per hour, back then and for the area if you had a job that paid $9-10 per hour you'd be considered lucky, the bill to get my teeth worked on would have cost 1/2 of the money I'd make in a year before taxes. 



Finally in 2021 I'm in a position to get my teeth fixed, in this time I've removed myself 4 of my back teeth all ones that were completely broken, all that needs to be done is to fix up some cavities that resulted from when my mouth would be in too much pain to get efficiently clean early on before I knew how to get antibiotics and before the aca afforded me cheaper visits to an actual doctor for real antibiotics. 


It's been YEARS since the aca was passed and nothing about how the us healthcare system treats dental care had changed, 

Dental care is health care, none of us choose to have teeth, they aren't a luxury, they are not an aesthetic choice. Infections can literally kill you, you need teeth to fucking eat.


You'd be surprised that removing your own teeth without antistatic is LESS painful then an infection In/above a tooth, also if a tooth gets infected enough the nerve in it will die making it REALLY easy to remove.

I recently went to the Verizon store to buy a new phone because my last one was useless. So I went in and the person ""helping"" me out was named Karen. That should have been my first sign to leave.

I texted her about an hour later to have the appointment to set up the phone and she told me I could come in about an hour later that day. So I get to the store when she said to and I'm almost certain she didn't even remember me from 2 hours before. I handed her my phone and asked if everything can be transferred into the new phone. She asked me if I had the new phone and I told her that I was trying to buy one (which was why I was in the store to begin with). She then told me that the phone would be mailed to me, and THEN she could transfer the info. First of all, that still made no sense because they HAD the actual phone in the store,, so why not just give it to me right there?? Also, why tf would you tell me to come in later that day when you know I don't have the phone? So yeah I went to the store just so she could tell me the phone is getting mailed.

But wait... her stupidy is not over yet. I checked my service plan with Verizon a few days later and no indication that a new phone was on its way. I went back into the store to find a new dude and found out that the only thing Karen did was upgrade my warranty plan or some shit like that, idk.

Also, why tf would you tell me to come in later that day when you know I don&amp;#39;t have the phone? So yeah I went to the store just so she could tell me the phone is getting mailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait... her stupidy is not over yet. I checked my service plan with Verizon a few days later and no indication that a new phone was on its way. I went back into the store to find a new dude and found out that the only thing Karen did was upgrade my warranty plan or some shit like that, idk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this new guy was actually helpful and I walked out of the store with a new phone and accessories 30 minutes later. Even he had no idea what the hell Karen was doing when I explained it.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't care if they're ""just insects"", that doesn't make them any less annoying or any more intelligent. No offense but after centuries and eons of evolution you'd think the world would have taught these annoying fucks to stay away from larger creatures, especially humans.

I am hated on the internet. I know I&amp;#39;m not exactly innocent in this situation, but seriously? At this point, I&amp;#39;ve given up on social media. If nobody likes me in real life, why would they like me online? Especially given how unforgiving, rude, and angry people on the internet can be. I wanted to go on the internet to have fun, not to increase my ever-growing list of people who hate me (which is very long). (btw I&amp;#39;m fifteen, so not underage for discord)&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"As we all know, for a year governments almost everywhere in the West have applied incredibly authoritarian measures in the hope of stopping Covid. This has been an almost unmitigated failure, for various reasons but likely mostly because Covid is relatively easy to catch so even if you stay locked up 99.9% of the time for a year, you might still catch it during your 5-minutes trip to the grocery store to buy essential items.

But let’s imagine we applied the same kind of measures to stop the spread of a 40-year-old disease that is both (1) much deadlier and (2) much harder to catch. I’m talking of course about AIDS.

Those measures could not be applied in ""Third World countries"" (just like Covid restrictions) but would be fairly easy to apply in  developed countries, especially compared to Covid restrictions:

(1) mass mandatory testing of at-risk population: way easier than Covid mass testing since the at-risk population is even smaller;

(2) prohibition from engaging in at-risk activities unless you benefit from an-up-to-date negative test: for Covid at-risk activities are ""leaving your home, and even staying at-home you can still catch it unless you live alone and never get delivery and starve to death and even then it’s possible we will find a way you can still
catch it somehow"" and furthermore there is never any ending date  to restrictions since just leaving your home to get tested and then coming back from the test is an at-risk activities. So for Covid these restrictions are useless. By contrast, for AIDS, the list of at-risk activities is extremely short. I seem to recall from high school that the test results take a few weeks. So, all you have to do if you are an at-risk individual who has been tested is not engage in those risky activities for a couple of weeks waiting for the results. Then you get a ""sanitary passeport"" and can go back to engage in those activities with any other man benefiting from such passeport.

(3) Since we can’t apply these measures in the ""Third World"", all we have to do is apply limited travel restrictions to anyone coming from at-risk countries where the ""sanitary passport"" cannot be applied: any visitor from such countries must get tested on arrival and engaging in any at-risk activities until a sanitary passport can be granted is liable to criminal prosecution. Or even cut the middleman and just forbid such activities to any visitor from such countries (especially if their stay is too short to get a test result).

(4) Finally, visiting such countries from developed countries is also subject to mandatory testing on return and criminal prosecution for engaging in at-risk activities until a negative result can be obtained.

Those kinds of restrictions would be extremely less restrictive than the ones imposed to everyone on the pretext of Covid (in fact in countries such as UK it is currently forbidden to engage in these activities on the pretext of Covid anyway) and extremely more successful. Within a year tops, AIDS could be eradicated in developed countries and only measures 3 and 4 could remain.

I challenge you to give me any reason why we can’t apply these measures (less restrictive, with a clear limited duration, extremely more effective, against a much deadlier disease) to eradicate AIDS but we can apply them for Covid (much much much more restrictive, by definition never-ending, clearly completely ineffective, against a much less deadly disease that only targets the elderly and the obese).",t2_5z2cs3dm,False,,0,False,"If we applied 1% of the kind of restrictions applied to stop Covid to stop AIDS, AIDS would be eradicated within a year, at least in developed countries",[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_m1466r,False,dark,0.89,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,1615287943.0,,[],{},,True,,1615316557.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know, for a year governments almost everywhere in the West have applied incredibly authoritarian measures in the hope of stopping Covid.

People literally say “I don’t usually ____” as if that’s the big reason they can’t explore or check out what they’ve never heard or seen before. For example “I don’t usually listen to metal.” so i guess there’s no reason to ever check out any of the millions of metal albums that exist in the world because there’s absolutely no chance of you liking even one metal song huh

I remember one time in Highschool, my history teacher was showing a basketball game for some reason, and everyone in the class before the video was like “uggh i hate sports!!1 just putting a ball in a bucket smh -_-”

... 5 minutes into this game *everyone* is at the edge of their seat because OF COURSE it’s entertaining to see the art of human exercise put into dramatic motion (in this context, drama meaning rules, point systems etc) and most art out here is just like that. So harmless that I don’t see why you can’t just enjoy things while they’re there.

I’m realizing I’m super unrelatable because I can go off fanboying over American Football and The Boondocks for a super long time just to turn around and start blabbing about Contrapoints and Curb Your Enthusiasm. I can play Mario Maker for hours and eventually switch over to Baldur’s Gate 2, then COD — whereas it seems like so many people just can’t stand games that aren’t like CoD.

I’ve noticed my taste is all over the place to the point where I can connect with most people, but over few things for each person.

I’m a support worker for people with mental health issues, and we try and encourage and teach these people to live as independently and freely as possible. 

I was out with a client yesterday and he decided to start playing his favourite game, “I can’t do it.” He’s more than capable of doing a lot of things by himself but will play up for some extra attention by claiming he can’t do things, and will generally look and act in a way that implies his condition is a lot worse than it actually is. Anyway we’re all wise to this game and will continue to prompt him until he does The Thing by himself. 

So he starts shaking and saying “I can’t count my money”, I know full well that he can count his money so I encourage him saying “You got this, you do this all the time I know you can count it” and we’re doing pretty well until this middle aged maskless monster in the queue behind us pokes her head over my shoulder and goes “You CLEARLY need to help him.” 

I take a step back because, uhhhhhh, hello potential covid lady, and try to explain that he can do it by himself he just needs a little time and we really appreciate your patience. She then SHOVES ME OUT THE WAY sighing “Oh I’ll do it then” and tries to take his money from his hand. 

Well the client is absolutely LIVING for the attention and I’m there panicking because some complete stranger has my client’s money so I manage to get it back off her and start counting it myself just to get us out of there. She’s still hovering over my shoulder like a Boomer Gargoyle so I turn round and snap “We’ve got it from here.” 

She’s all smug because she got to tell someone off in public and my client is all excitable and shouting weird stuff and laughing like a demon so I just bail out of there, but not before she gets in my face again and says “Just do your job.”

Now I am an extremely non violent person but I very nearly put that lady’s smug head through the till. 

Anyway for the rest of the day, my client refused to do ANYTHING by himself, insisting that someone help him with even super basic stuff, so THANK YOU Helpful Karen for your interference and I hope I never see your irritating, leathery, maskless face again.

,rant,"My dog is turning 12 years old this year; I've had her since I was 8. She's a small/medium-ish mix of who-knows-what-terrier and I love her to death. Now, for the 12 years we have had her, we've never cleaned her teeth. It wasn't until a few days ago that I learned just how important dental health is to a dog. It's **stupid** because *of course* dogs have dental problems and it affects their way of life but I never connected the dots, truly.  My parents always said that it was rich people who had nothing better to do with their time who would brush their dog's teeth. Dogs are just animals, they'd say. 

She has absolutely, god-awful breath that I cannot describe. From what I can remember (because rn I'm away at college) parts of her gums/teeth were black/yellow and really gross. I remember telling this to my parents at some point, then them telling me ""she's a dog, she's supposed to be gross, what were you expecting?"" I felt like I sounded silly, so I assumed they were right and never questioned it. Reading more into it now, there is absolutely no way that she doesn't have an infection and bacteria/tartar buildup that's discomforting her. She's always had problems puking here and there, doesn't gain much weight, doesn't eat any treats (esp not the teeth cleaning kind), and takes her time when eating. We waived it off as drinking water too quickly, not being that hungry, not liking treats, and being picky with her dog food/kibble. She's always been like that, but I can't believe I never connected the dots that she might be having dental problems. I feel so stupid. 

I mentioned this to my parents (because I'm in college and don't have that type of money yet). I had called a few vet clinics already for quotes, learned how the process works. The quotes I received were around $300-700 (one even said $1k) and I can't pay that entirely; I didn't mention the price to them though. I just asked what they thought about taking her to get her teeth cleaned. They immediately said ""No."" That dog's breaths are supposed to stink because they're animals. I *know* they are, but hers is SERIOUSLY bad. I cannot emphasize how gross it is. Here's how my dad responded: *Déjale sus dientes ahí y si no le sirven, pues no los usa pero ese jale no está bien para los perros. Ellos no fueron diseñados para ir al dentista.* Translation: Leave her teeth be, if they don't work, then she won't use them but that stuff/work isn't good for dogs. They weren't designed to go to the dentist.

UMMMMMM pls remind me, **when** were humans **designed** to go to the dentist lol ???? didn't dental care get invented afterward lmaoo

They're convinced that all the stuff ""Americans"" (for them, this means white people lol) do for their dogs is ridiculous, unnecessary and a waste of money. I've considered their childhood and how life *was* back in Mexico. They both grew up in small remote towns with barely enough money to feed themselves (at some point, my dad would be looking for food in the trash for them to eat) and never enough to keep a pet. Dogs were just strays that follow you around, go through your trash, bite/chase you, and eventually die. Things have changed and keeping pets is more normal in their towns now (from what I've seen when I visit). Both of their parents even have pets of their own. But dogs there aren't walked; they are either chilling/barking in the backyard or loose on the street. They eat dog food or whatever leftover food is on the ground and chill. (For some reason though, despite their living conditions, Mexican dogs live FOREVER. Like, longer than the average lifespan. It just doesn't add up). Pets just weren't a thing as they grew up and I understand that. I can't blame them for not having the same privileges I now have. But things are different now!

Do I not remember you saying she's family? Saying that y'all love her so much? That it's so amazing that she is so caring and loving of us? She sometimes appears more human than dog? She's the best dog one could have? She is irreplaceable? That we need to give her as much love and care as we can because she's getting old? They claim they love my dog so much but they gave me *such* a hard time the last time I took her to the vet (because she was puking so often; thinking back, they never checked her teeth). Now that I mention dental issues, they think I'm being *extra* dramatic. But to think that my dog could be in pain and suffering over this problem we have overlooked for more than a decade? And they won't even consider taking her in for a general exam. They're convinced vets are here to steal our money. **I feel like such a terrible dog owner.** I got her when I was 8 years old; there's just so much they don't know about dog care and I wasn't aware of that. 

I'm at an out-of-state college, so I can't be with her right now. I made a big deal of it and my dad agreed to ""take care of it."" He's pissed at me, so I won't make him angrier right now, but I'm worried he won't actually take her to the vet. I'm planning on going home for spring break (because I'm literally depressed and miss my family); if she hasn't gone, I'm going to take her and find some way to pay for it myself. 

Honestly though, part of me doesn't want to take her. Even though she's healthy and happy, I'm afraid of putting her under anesthesia. Because of COVID, I can't enter the clinic when they examine her. We never trained her (surprise surprise) and she's very nervous with strangers so I'm so scared for her. I want to believe what they believe: that cleaning a dog's teeth is stupid and she'll be completely fine. But I know that's not the truth and that she needs this, especially if I want to keep her around for longer. I'm just scared because we've never done this before and I'm the only one asking for it. If anything bad were to happen, it would be because I wanted this done. I'm trying to remember that I'm prioritizing her health and well-being. But after 12 years of dental neglect (I think that's an appropriate way of calling it), I'm afraid it might be too much for her. Plus, the stories of dogs dying alone in the vet bc of COVID and surgical procedures have me terrified. It is just a cleaning, but the fear is real. 

I'm still going to go through with it, just frustrated that I'm alone in thinking that this is important.

TLDR: My 12 yo dog's teeth have never been cleaned bc my family thought that was stupid/a waste of money.  I have just learned that a dog's dental health is so important, but I'm being clowned for mentioning the idea. I feel mad at them and myself for neglecting my baby.",t2_3cj7il7v,False,,0,False,"I didn't know how important a dog's dental care was, I was always told it was stupid and unnecessary.

It wasn&amp;#39;t until a few days ago that I learned just how important dental health is to a dog. It&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;stupid&lt;/strong&gt; because &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; dogs have dental problems and it affects their way of life but I never connected the dots, truly.  My parents always said that it was rich people who had nothing better to do with their time who would brush their dog&amp;#39;s teeth. Dogs are just animals, they&amp;#39;d say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has absolutely, god-awful breath that I cannot describe. From what I can remember (because rn I&amp;#39;m away at college) parts of her gums/teeth were black/yellow and really gross. I remember telling this to my parents at some point, then them telling me &amp;quot;she&amp;#39;s a dog, she&amp;#39;s supposed to be gross, what were you expecting?&amp;quot; I felt like I sounded silly, so I assumed they were right and never questioned it. Reading more into it now, there is absolutely no way that she doesn&amp;#39;t have an infection and bacteria/tartar buildup that&amp;#39;s discomforting her. She&amp;#39;s always had problems puking here and there, doesn&amp;#39;t gain much weight, doesn&amp;#39;t eat any treats (esp not the teeth cleaning kind), and takes her time when eating. We waived it off as drinking water too quickly, not being that hungry, not liking treats, and being picky with her dog food/kibble. She&amp;#39;s always been like that, but I can&amp;#39;t believe I never connected the dots that she might be having dental problems. I feel so stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this to my parents (because I&amp;#39;m in college and don&amp;#39;t have that type of money yet). I had called a few vet clinics already for quotes, learned how the process works. The quotes I received were around $300-700 (one even said $1k) and I can&amp;#39;t pay that entirely; I didn&amp;#39;t mention the price to them though. I just asked what they thought about taking her to get her teeth cleaned. They immediately said &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; That dog&amp;#39;s breaths are supposed to stink because they&amp;#39;re animals. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; they are, but hers is SERIOUSLY bad. I cannot emphasize how gross it is. Here&amp;#39;s how my dad responded: &lt;em&gt;Déjale sus dientes ahí y si no le sirven, pues no los usa pero ese jale no está bien para los perros. Ellos no fueron diseñados para ir al dentista.&lt;/em&gt; Translation: Leave her teeth be, if they don&amp;#39;t work, then she won&amp;#39;t use them but that stuff/work isn&amp;#39;t good for dogs. They weren&amp;#39;t designed to go to the dentist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UMMMMMM pls remind me, &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; were humans &lt;strong&gt;designed&lt;/strong&gt; to go to the dentist lol ???? didn&amp;#39;t dental care get invented afterward lmaoo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re convinced that all the stuff &amp;quot;Americans&amp;quot; (for them, this means white people lol) do for their dogs is ridiculous, unnecessary and a waste of money. I&amp;#39;ve considered their childhood and how life &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; back in Mexico. They both grew up in small remote towns with barely enough money to feed themselves (at some point, my dad would be looking for food in the trash for them to eat) and never enough to keep a pet. Dogs were just strays that follow you around, go through your trash, bite/chase you, and eventually die. Things have changed and keeping pets is more normal in their towns now (from what I&amp;#39;ve seen when I visit). Both of their parents even have pets of their own. But dogs there aren&amp;#39;t walked; they are either chilling/barking in the backyard or loose on the street. They eat dog food or whatever leftover food is on the ground and chill. (For some reason though, despite their living conditions, Mexican dogs live FOREVER. Like, longer than the average lifespan. It just doesn&amp;#39;t add up). Pets just weren&amp;#39;t a thing as they grew up and I understand that. I can&amp;#39;t blame them for not having the same privileges I now have. But things are different now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I not remember you saying she&amp;#39;s family? Saying that y&amp;#39;all love her so much? That it&amp;#39;s so amazing that she is so caring and loving of us? She sometimes appears more human than dog? She&amp;#39;s the best dog one could have? She is irreplaceable? That we need to give her as much love and care as we can because she&amp;#39;s getting old? They claim they love my dog so much but they gave me &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a hard time the last time I took her to the vet (because she was puking so often; thinking back, they never checked her teeth). Now that I mention dental issues, they think I&amp;#39;m being &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; dramatic. But to think that my dog could be in pain and suffering over this problem we have overlooked for more than a decade? And they won&amp;#39;t even consider taking her in for a general exam. They&amp;#39;re convinced vets are here to steal our money. &lt;strong&gt;I feel like such a terrible dog owner.&lt;/strong&gt; I got her when I was 8 years old; there&amp;#39;s just so much they don&amp;#39;t know about dog care and I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at an out-of-state college, so I can&amp;#39;t be with her right now. I made a big deal of it and my dad agreed to &amp;quot;take care of it.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s pissed at me, so I won&amp;#39;t make him angrier right now, but I&amp;#39;m worried he won&amp;#39;t actually take her to the vet. I&amp;#39;m planning on going home for spring break (because I&amp;#39;m literally depressed and miss my family); if she hasn&amp;#39;t gone, I&amp;#39;m going to take her and find some way to pay for it myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, part of me doesn&amp;#39;t want to take her. Even though she&amp;#39;s healthy and happy, I&amp;#39;m afraid of putting her under anesthesia. Because of COVID, I can&amp;#39;t enter the clinic when they examine her. We never trained her (surprise surprise) and she&amp;#39;s very nervous with strangers so I&amp;#39;m so scared for her. I want to believe what they believe: that cleaning a dog&amp;#39;s teeth is stupid and she&amp;#39;ll be completely fine. But I know that&amp;#39;s not the truth and that she needs this, especially if I want to keep her around for longer. I&amp;#39;m just scared because we&amp;#39;ve never done this before and I&amp;#39;m the only one asking for it. If anything bad were to happen, it would be because I wanted this done. I&amp;#39;m trying to remember that I&amp;#39;m prioritizing her health and well-being. But after 12 years of dental neglect (I think that&amp;#39;s an appropriate way of calling it), I&amp;#39;m afraid it might be too much for her. Plus, the stories of dogs dying alone in the vet bc of COVID and surgical procedures have me terrified. It is just a cleaning, but the fear is real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still going to go through with it, just frustrated that I&amp;#39;m alone in thinking that this is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My 12 yo dog&amp;#39;s teeth have never been cleaned bc my family thought that was stupid/a waste of money.  I have just learned that a dog&amp;#39;s dental health is so important, but I&amp;#39;m being clowned for mentioning the idea. I feel mad at them and myself for neglecting my baby.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"I don't know why the grading system has to be such a pain and source of stress. Like, yes, theoretically if I put all my effort into doing this one class, I'll get the A I want and need..... but I never have only one class. My teachers expect me to do well if I study, but y'all realize that it's difficult when stuff starts merging? I usually have like three quizzes every Friday, all on different classes, that I have to study for ON TOP of the other classes I have to study for long term, each having their own exam, their own quizzes, and their own essays. It's gotten to the point where I'm just calculating which assignments I can afford to fail or do poorly on specifically because I cannot do everything and get the A I would be able to get if the course material was graded in a respectable manner. 

For instance, making all of your material exams and quizzes is gonna give the students anxiety and make them hate the subject. Before I met certain teachers or took certain classes- I liked the material, now, I dislike it purely because it reminds me of the stress. I used to love english and look forward to taking the classes- now I'm scared of taking another english class because of the pure hell my last professor put me through of not telling me about quizzes and projects and due dates, acting like he was the only one who had other classes, and not even letting us do rough drafts. I was one of the few students who passed his class with a B, when I'm normally an A in english. If he'd let us do rough drafts, I'm sure I would have gotten a A. 

Exams. I hate them. They are pointless. I once studied algebraic fractions, and got an A on the exam.... I know nothing about algebraic fractions, I wouldn't even be able to explain how to do a simple equation if you asked me. This because it was all placed into short term memory, not long term. It was something I memorized for a test, not something I learned for life. To any professors reading this:

Do you wanna know how to make quizzes actually not as stressful and a total turn off the subject to students? Make them unlimited attempts. Yes, we actually learn something then, from the damn quiz. Only one of my courses is formatted like this, and it's the only course I can say I'm actually enjoying. The exams aren't worth as much as the projects and you don't fuck your grade up if you don't do very well on them the first try. 

You can even make the quizzes lockdown browser or whatever, with no open notes- just limited tries until a certain due date! Let's say you give the students 30 quizzes for the entire semester. You can literally just make the first 15 due by the middle of the semester, and the next 15 due by the end of semester. Do you know how much my mental health and that of my peers would improve? I swear it's like sadistic to make students this stressed out about learning things. 

Or, perhaps give an alternative assignment to exams, like essays or a project or some alternative that's the equivalent. 

But seriously, that's why most students cheat. I bet nobody would cheat if it was unlimited attempts. The suicide rates would probably go down to if it was like this everywhere. I'm just saying, exams kill. 

Anyway, because I'm just memorizing I'm probably gonna forget everything I've learned in, like, biology, because it's just brain dumping for the test. I considered biology, but then I took a biology class and the learning format was just all quizzes and tests so because I don't learn that way, I can't study biology in an academic format and get a degree in the field. I also now associate biology with stress. Thanks for that, I wonder what could have happened if it had a better learning format.",t2_3k09l9n9,False,,0,False,I Dislike The Grading System,[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_m0upnx,False,dark,0.88,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615279603.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why the grading system has to be such a pain and source of stress. Like, yes, theoretically if I put all my effort into doing this one class, I&amp;#39;ll get the A I want and need..... but I never have only one class. My teachers expect me to do well if I study, but y&amp;#39;all realize that it&amp;#39;s difficult when stuff starts merging? I usually have like three quizzes every Friday, all on different classes, that I have to study for ON TOP of the other classes I have to study for long term, each having their own exam, their own quizzes, and their own essays. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where I&amp;#39;m just calculating which assignments I can afford to fail or do poorly on specifically because I cannot do everything and get the A I would be able to get if the course material was graded in a respectable manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, making all of your material exams and quizzes is gonna give the students anxiety and make them hate the subject. Before I met certain teachers or took certain classes- I liked the material, now, I dislike it purely because it reminds me of the stress. I used to love english and look forward to taking the classes- now I&amp;#39;m scared of taking another english class because of the pure hell my last professor put me through of not telling me about quizzes and projects and due dates, acting like he was the only one who had other classes, and not even letting us do rough drafts. I was one of the few students who passed his class with a B, when I&amp;#39;m normally an A in english. If he&amp;#39;d let us do rough drafts, I&amp;#39;m sure I would have gotten a A. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exams. I hate them. They are pointless. I once studied algebraic fractions, and got an A on the exam.... I know nothing about algebraic fractions, I wouldn&amp;#39;t even be able to explain how to do a simple equation if you asked me. This because it was all placed into short term memory, not long term. It was something I memorized for a test, not something I learned for life. To any professors reading this:&lt;/p&gt;

I got up to my computer absolutely shredding it's hard drive. I have absolutely no clue how, but it just scratched the shit out of itself, and now two and a half years of songwriting is gone. I cant even remake any of it, because it was all written during some of the actual hardest times of my life and it's near end, and I cant just reimagine that pain.

Then I realized I hadn't even really slept at all for some mystery reason. I'm thinking some weird wombo combo of tinnitus, restless leg syndrome, and just general restlessness. I also noticed I was 40 minutes late for school. Great.

I broke my nose moving my rifle at colour guard. I dont even know how I managed it. I just went to move to my shoulder and I guess flew too close to the sun. Looked up at my colonel with a bloody face and got dismissed without a word.

I finally get home, only to have an allergy attack and sneeze like 70 times. Not great when my nose is on fire.

I go on xbox and try to chill with friends, and one fuckin kicks me and sets it on invite-only. I ask why the hell the guy did that, and no-one knew, but no-one let me back in. If I pulled that shit they'd chew me out, but I guess it's alright if their fuckin dominatrix does it.

I want this day to fuckin end but I hate trying to sleep. I hate lying down and just thinking about how boring the world is. I want someone to just put me to work and give me a task. I dont even care if it's the most menial shit, I just hate sitting around for hours while people waste my fucking time.

&lt;p&gt;I got up to my computer absolutely shredding it&amp;#39;s hard drive. I have absolutely no clue how, but it just scratched the shit out of itself, and now two and a half years of songwriting is gone. I cant even remake any of it, because it was all written during some of the actual hardest times of my life and it&amp;#39;s near end, and I cant just reimagine that pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized I hadn&amp;#39;t even really slept at all for some mystery reason. I&amp;#39;m thinking some weird wombo combo of tinnitus, restless leg syndrome, and just general restlessness. I also noticed I was 40 minutes late for school. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke my nose moving my rifle at colour guard. I dont even know how I managed it. I just went to move to my shoulder and I guess flew too close to the sun. Looked up at my colonel with a bloody face and got dismissed without a word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally get home, only to have an allergy attack and sneeze like 70 times. Not great when my nose is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go on xbox and try to chill with friends, and one fuckin kicks me and sets it on invite-only. I ask why the hell the guy did that, and no-one knew, but no-one let me back in. If I pulled that shit they&amp;#39;d chew me out, but I guess it&amp;#39;s alright if their fuckin dominatrix does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this day to fuckin end but I hate trying to sleep. I hate lying down and just thinking about how boring the world is. I want someone to just put me to work and give me a task. I dont even care if it&amp;#39;s the most menial shit, I just hate sitting around for hours while people waste my fucking time.

The only thing she struggles with in keeping focus in new environments. She gets distracted very easliy.
Well the other day I took her to my Auntie's new house and she got very excited and was jumping up saying hello to everyone and they we're all patting her (even though I told them to ignore her till she calmed down). 
Anyway the dog gets super excited and distracted and starts not listening to any of the commands I give her.

And it takes a lot to make me angry but that sentence made me so mad that I got up and left.
Under no circumstances should you hit your dog. It teaches them nothing but to be fearful or aggressive. 
If you do not have the god damn patience to teach your dog properly and you feel like you have to dominate and bully them into submission, you do not deserve to have a fucking dog!
She also recommended scruffing the dog, which means to force it onto it's back or side and holding it down because she said it made her dog calm. But if you research that method you'll find that it actually created a fear based emotional response. It doesn't calm the dog down it makes the dog shut down. And teaches it nothing!

And anyone that has a beagle knows that they are energetic and Stubborn and can get really fixated on things. 
My dog and I train every day, she has done really well at learning commands and am so proud of her. 
The only thing she struggles with in keeping focus in new environments. She gets distracted very easliy.
Well the other day I took her to my Auntie&amp;#39;s new house and she got very excited and was jumping up saying hello to everyone and they we&amp;#39;re all patting her (even though I told them to ignore her till she calmed down). 
Anyway the dog gets super excited and distracted and starts not listening to any of the commands I give her.

,rant,"No, my lifelong problems that began when I was underweight as a tween are not caused by my current weight. No, my high ALT levels are NOT because of my drinking, or medications, because as I said in the appointment, I do not drink, and I do not take any medications. So laying off those things will, in fact, not change anything about my ALT levels. They had nothing to do with it in the first place. I told you at the beginning, that I do not do those things. Also, not that you asked about my medical history at all, weirdly enough, but as a teenager I did some things that greatly increased my risk for liver problems down the road. You know. Several years later, which, hmm, seems like it's been about that long!

Also, being low risk for breast cancer doesn't mean that the total, sudden change in shape, texture and color off my breasts is nothing to worry about. Not feeling a lump in there also doesn't mean there isn't an issue, and your job, as a doctor, is to help me find out what is going on. The cup of coffee that I have most, but not all, mornings, is not going to be the cause of my areola being suddenly concaved.

No, my hips, knees and ankles being suddenly very weak and stiff and in constant pain does NOT mean that I am too sedentary. And also, no, I did not fall because I couldn't handle the pain and stiffness. I fell because my hips would not support my weight, and I do know that is the case, because joint pain is nothing new to me and I know my capabilities in handling it better than you do. Because, you know, I'm feeling it. I can tell the difference.

Barely bruising at all over my 2+ decades of life, and then suddenly bruising a ridiculous amount very easily actually is a cause of concern. Yeah, I know that ""most people get bumps and bruises throughout the day"", but the fact that it was a sudden change, in line with all of these other issues that I'm having, kind of indicates that maybe something else is going on. It seems like a doctor would be able to piece that together on their own, but I guess not.

By the way, I am sick and tired of hearing that hormone levels fluctuate, because I am aware of this. Trust me, I know that. But the fact that my results were very out of line with my typical age group and sex expectations, I think that maybe, given my completely unpredictable periods, the ones where I bleed through a S tampon and a nighttime pad within an hour, over and over, for days at a time, the ones where if I don't set an alarm to get up each hour and change that stuff I'll ruin the mattress with blood... I think maybe it's something to look at.

And I shouldn't have to DEMAND blood tests, I shouldn't have to DEMAND someone look into my symptoms. I shouldn't have to DEMAND that my health be taken seriously, and I shouldn't have to piece together most of the puzzle just so that you or any of the other doctors I quit going to for the same reason, will say more to me than ""lose some weight"" or ""it's probably nothing"". I don't have the goddamn money, the time or the fucking energy to spend on this, and recently, there was blood in my shit. More than once, in fact, there had been blood there, which seems a little coincidental that it lines up with my random, upper-stomach bloating up a bunch.

So what are my options here, exactly? Fight you, or some other doctor, and demand testing, and demand that you narrow down what might be wrong with me? I barely even want to be alive most of the time, and now I have to fight so that somebody else will care if I'm sick or not? I have other things going on that need doing, and now I have to do them with all the rest of the usual stuff that makes it difficult- like my poor health, my poor mental health, my stress from all my sick or dangerously depressed family and friends- but I have to do it with the knowledge, in the back of my mind, that something is probably very wrong with my body. And the knowledge that if I don't fight to have someone who can do something about it, do something about it, nothing will be done because for some goddamn reason people talk to me, or look at me, or something, and they decide that nothing that I say is anything that matters.

Ok so hi queer people, idk if you’re aware but there’s been this “super straight movement” going on (basically it’s transphobic, mocks the lgbtq+ community, and has Nazi undertones it started from 4chan but I’m not gonna go in depth on that)

Please. Do not give them attention. Don’t talk about it. If they comment or have the pfp just block them, delete their comment off your page and keep it pushing. 

They what attention pretty much. It’s just trolls trolling and tryna stir shit up. Theit whole point is basically movking the lgbtq+ community saying “if you think superstraight is made up so is gay and lesbian” just superstupid shit reslly.

Don’t pay attention to it, just block and report. If we don’t pay them any mind it will go away and they’ll move on to getting attention dom other way.

On another note I find it really sad how desperate people are for attention. Mfs will go as far as being openly racist and homophobic just for attention. Mfs will publicly humiliate themselves for attention, validation from other people.

I just feel like a lot of the mfs who are doing this ss thing just need to stop for a moment and rethink what they’re doing. There’s other ways to get attention so why be negative for no reason. 

And there y’all go in the comments “Alex they’re just using your logic” no they are not. (Shoutout to berleezy if you got that reference ily)

There’s a difference between a preference and being flat out transphobic 

You can be straight and prefere to date a biological women or someone who’s Afab. That’s fine we as a community don’t care. It’s when you say “I’m SS I prefer REAL women.” It invalidates trans people who ARE real women just with different body parts. (don’t argue with me in the comments I will ignore you it’s a pointless battle) and even then it’s not a body part issue they won’t even date a trans women who got bottom surgery ( and claim it’s because she’d be infertile) when biological women and afab people can be infertile. It’s blatant transphobia and not a preference 

And I emphasis on that. 

And idrc if you don’t support trans people that’s your buisness but misgdenring too. Like who cares. 

And I honestly, ss people if you identify as transphobic that’s chill but keep it out of my comment section. Queer people just ignore it. People who don’t think trans people are legit that’s chill but literally the bare minimum just respect their pronouns. 

I dead ass don’t understand why mfs can’t just respect eachother. If you don’t like what someone’s doing or they have different beliefs  and you know it’s negative (I’m talking like racism and trans people: only talk to those with an open mindset you’ll end up in pointless arguments a lot)  you can either ignore it or let it affect you. 

Eventually everyone whos old racist transphobic and homophobic will get their karma.

Now a little bit of background before I get into this, 
I am 15 years old, I’m a minor and can’t get therapy without my parents consent, and I am 98% sure my mother is emotionally abusing me. 
She dismisses just about everything I bring up, even things I told her will be beneficial for me.
(Example: I’ve told her that I should edit my 504 plan to help me understand things better and she just rejected the idea. Even sounded disappointed in me)
I just learned what gaslighting is, and she does that a lot 
(Example: just today I was telling her things, trying to reason with her on things she can do better as a parent. Like getting me into therapy, (she’s been “trying” for 4 months now, she just sits on her butt all day and does whatever on her phone) but she just brought up my “depression” which is her trying to convince me I have depression, because what else could it be? It’s not like there’s hundreds of disorders out there that explain exactly what I’m going through? Anyway she makes me question my own knowledge on my self, says she knows more about me then I do) 
I’m sorry for getting aggressive in that example.
I just want to know for the person who is more experienced with this.
Is this abuse?
And if so,
Is it good enough reason to leave?
Because I will admit, 
They give me food, I have a phone, I have an iPad, I have all of my needs and some wants taken care of. 
Also it’s only my mom who acts this way, my dad is more so just a helicopter parent, who won’t let me go to the park because it’s “too far” 
I’ve been wanting to leave for a while because I don’t think these are healthy living situations, especially for a child such as myself. 
If I am completely wrong with everything I’m sorry for wasting your time. 
But is this abuse? Is this enough to report to CPS? 
If I am wrong, what should I do?

,rant,"This is gonna be a rant at one of my roommates that I’m too chicken-shit to actually tell them. By “us” I’m meaning my boyfriend and myself. We live with another couple. I’m not sure where else I can express my feelings so this is where it’s going. 

You don’t even talk to us unless your partner is in the room with you. While she’s at work, you’re either playing on her switch and ignoring us or you’re downstairs in your room, but in either case you’re not even acknowledging our presence. But the second she comes home, you’re acting like nothing is wrong when we’re in the room and apparently have no problems airing your grievances when we’re not in the room with y’all. 

We know you talk shit about us to your partner, and have been for at least a damn month. Either you think you’re quiet, we’re completely stupid, or you straight up don’t care, but the shit you say hurts, especially when you won’t even talk to us. I heard what you said about me on Super Bowl Sunday. Yes, my reaction wasn’t normal, but instead of speaking to me like a rational adult to see if something else was bothering me, you decided to run and tell your partner and laugh at me. Did it occur to you at all that maybe I was having a bad day prior to that? Did you stop to consider that I have shit going on in my life and that watching the fucking cheater Tom Brady in the super bowl was just the icing on top? You didn’t even bother to ask me what was wrong. Maybe my horse that’s a thousand miles away ran through a fence and tore their legs up and I can’t be there to do anything. Maybe my dad got in a car wreck on a run to Wisconsin and neither my mom nor I could get to him to help him. Maybe my cat that I sent to my parent’s house a thousand miles away because you wouldn’t get off my fucking ass got sick and nobody can figure out why he’s shitting blood. But it’s not like you’d know. If you would get out of your fucking bubble and talk to me like a damn fucking adult that I think you are, you’d have some understanding. But no, it’s much better to run to your partner and laugh and make fun of me.

I also fucking heard your conversation this afternoon on your partner’s lunch break. You wanted to watch Birds of Prey with her for international women’s day and said that “it’d have to be an in (partner’s) room movie” because you “didn’t want to deal with the peanut gallery”. All because you didn’t want to deal with us being in the living room. Maybe, if you used words like a fucking adult, we could’ve arranged for us to be in our room or even watch it with you, but instead you unilaterally decided that it had to be watched in your partner’s room. Didn’t even ask for your partner’s opinion to see if she wanted to ask us to leave y’all alone or if we wanted to watch with y’all. If you’re gonna talk shit, either wait till I’m not in the house or get fucking quieter. I’m not sure if your partner says anything about us but if she does, at least she’s smart enough to stay too quiet for me to hear. Neither my boyfriend nor I had seen the fucking movie before, but you made assumptions, projected them onto us, and reacted without even talking to us. Like, for anything. Grow the actual hell up and communicate. It’s your partner’s TV; my boyfriend’s Xbox just happens to be connected to it, and we never once wanted anyone to feel like they couldn’t use the TV in the communal space. But you won’t fucking talk and communicate and find a solution like you should know how to do at 23 fucking years old. And then I thought I could be ballsy enough to say something, so that’s when I went to get water from the fridge you were standing next to. You both went “Hello!” like you didn’t just fucking say you didn’t want to deal with us. I came so damn close to saying “oh don’t mind me, I’m just part of the peanut gallery” but I’m too fucking wussy to do it. If you don’t want to deal with us, that’s perfectly fine, you don’t have to. But don’t turn around and be fake about your feelings and pretend you’re cool with us when it’s pretty damn clear you’re not. Pick a narrative and fucking stick to it. 

Not to mention the fact that I’m seeing some very startling behaviors in you towards your partner. When you’re not around, she’s happy to watch a movie with us or play Mario Kart on her switch together. But the second you show up, you both go isolate yourselves in her bedroom (which, in case you forgot, is directly next to mine and we share a damn wall so I can hear you, asshole) and do fuck all knows what. First, shit-talking people she knows and I assume she considers her friends, then you isolate yourselves away from those people, oh and they just happen to live in the same house? You are actively wanting her to be stuck in her room with you. Those are hallmarks for a mentally abusive relationship right there. And it’s not like you’re giving me any chances to see otherwise when you *isolate yourselves from everyone*. 

And the geranium. God damn you for this geranium. My boyfriend’s mother gave it to me as a gift before she moved across the country. I’ll admit I nearly killed it, so I asked you to help save it, and I truly do appreciate that you did, but I didn’t think I had to specify that I didn’t want you chopping off the healthy growth to water-propagate it for your own selfish reasons. Not to mention the fact that you never fucking asked me or even told me you were doing it; the only reason I know is because your partner told me about the one in her room that was propagated after the one you already successfully did. And then at least one more because my boyfriend watch you chop the top fucking half of it off. I trusted you and thought you were just trimming it to keep it the same size or maybe you were trimming the dead parts, but that is clearly not the case. This geranium is now shorter than when I was given it a year ago. THIS IS NOT WHAT I MEANT BY SAVING MY PLANT. I NEVER GAVE YOU PERMISSION YOU ENTITLED, NON-COMMUNICATIVE FUCKING ASSHOLE. Not to mention that instead of one main stem that was there when I moved in, there’s now 3 fucking stems in the pot and one of them wasn’t even standing up, it was just laying sideways so the leaves drooped down. So yeah, I rearranged the furniture in my room to put all the plants in my room so maybe you won’t fucking touch them. My boyfriend wants to take the ones you propagated back from you but honestly I don’t even fucking care about them anymore - I care about the sheer absence of respect towards me and my plant. 

We’ve already had the fight over the cats. But the reason I didn’t bring Falcon home at Christmas was because, before I even left to go to my parent’s, you were already dictating how we should and shouldn’t handle his return *AGAIN*. This is the exact thing I bitched at you about last time. And you felt that your online research and videos from having your cat for 9 months was better than the fact that 17 out of my 21 years of life have involved owning cats. And now we know it wasn’t Falcon’s fault because your partner’s cat keeps attacking *your own cat* like she did to mine and you STILL WANTED TO SAY IT WAS MY FAULT FOR NOT HAVING A LITTER BOX IN MY ROOM. My other cat does just fucking fine. It was never about the damn litter box, it was about Pandora trying to come into my room and Falcon was establishing his territory and/or Pandora’s undiagnosed gut issues making her feisty. I would’ve thought that seeing Pandora go after your own cat would’ve opened your fucking eyes but I guess you already have it in your brain that my cat and how I handle my cats is the problem and won’t be convinced otherwise. Fuck you for making me feel like a shitty cat owner because some guy on YouTube says something. Fuck you for trying to make flaws in every fucking thing I do with my cats. Yours is so goddamn skinny and eats anything and everything that she can get into, so I think she has hyperthyroidism, but I can’t say shit to you because you know better. You are the sole reason my cat didn’t come home with me. You. And if I’d known that my parents were going to suffer through a huge-ass ice storm that knocked power and water out for days, I would’ve sucked up your torment and brought him home. So now I even feel shitty for sending my cat, who is notably not the fucking problem, to a place where the weather killed at least 10 people, mainly so I could stop hearing you insult me and the way I take care of my cats. 

Noticed why I spend most of my days on campus? I have exactly one two-hour class everyday except fridays (two classes) and thursdays (no classes), but I will sit my ass on campus and wait for my boyfriend to get off work so he can bring me home (school is on the way home from his job). Ever cared why? I don’t feel welcome in my own home. I don’t feel respected or frankly even cared about by you. You proved it with the whole peanut gallery comment. The single reason that my boyfriend and I haven’t moved out early is because I know your partner has had some rough financial issues thanks to the pandemic and I like and respect her too much to make her suffer for my decision to get away from your actions. But after today...well, let’s just say that moving out early is back on the table. I’m fully aware that the lease ends in like, 10 weeks, but that’s about 10 weeks too fucking many to be treated like a ghost in my own home, but only on your terms. And this is just how I feel - I haven’t even mentioned the shit my boyfriend thinks and feels. 

And the absolute worst part of this is that because of your complete absence of respect and communication toward me, I don’t even know what I did wrong. What did I do to you? What did I say? Why won’t you tell me what’s wrong with me so I can fix my behavior? Why won’t you give me the chance to get better or more mature or grow or apologize? What can I do to change this dynamic? 

I used to consider you a sibling. I respected that you dealt with me through the darkest mental health period of my life and I sobbed when you agreed to live with me again, because I know I fucking sucked as a roommate last time. That person is the one I agreed to live with, not this noncommunicative, shit-talking, isolating, childish, entitled bully.",t2_4pbcw5la,False,,0,False,What did I ever do to you?,[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_m0zx9h,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615297350.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is gonna be a rant at one of my roommates that I’m too chicken-shit to actually tell them.

This story is circling around social media but to sum it up a black middle schooler was bullied by three racist white boys. Here’s a link to the whole story: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tag24.com/justice/crime/mother-seeks-justice-after-son-is-racially-abused-and-forced-to-drink-urine-by-schoolmates-1869093-amp The school knowingly did nothing about it. 

I’m not saying these children shouldn’t be punished by their school or parents. They 1000% should be punished and taught about how racism is inherently a bad thing. But THATS IT. I don’t want people to harass or bully these kids cause they are still kids and they should have time to grow. I saw this tik tok (actually made by someone who I personally knew) and they said that being young doesn’t excuse racism nor does it help the victim. And true, being passive to this isn’t the way to go but I could see the hidden implications to what she was saying. She was implying that being forgiven doesn’t help the victim and the trauma that they endured so society had every right to be vengeful. And me, knowing the monster and toxicity that is cancel culture, saw that, registered it and said, “they should be punished and taught better but they shouldn’t be harassed or bullied too.” And hell fire reigned down on me. 

People were LITERALLY fighting with me on whether or not we should harassed those white kids. I was called a coon. I was told to shut up. I’m fucking dying on this hill.

 If you believe in violence over peace you're a cunt.

Believe your religion should be made law in literally anyway? Congrats you're a huge fucking cunt. 

If you think the world would better if we attacking strangers instead of talking to them? You're not only a cunt but a fucking dumb cunt.  You can't fight ignorance with force. You can defend from it with force. But you cannot fight it with force. That only makes it worse. Talk to someone. Find common ground. Show them a different way. Don't just be the bigger person be the better person. Save someone from their hate. Don't just hate them. There is enough violence and hatred in this world. We don't need to add to it. We can be kind and we can be gentle and we can I don't know. 

I'm fucking crying now because the pain in the world is so fucking much and I see people at each others throats and I don't know what to say or what to do. I don't know how to fix it. I just want to make the world a better place. 

There is a great proverb I believe from Islam that I really like. ""Take a human life and it is as if you've killed all of humankind. Save a human life and it is as if you've saved all of mankind."" 

I do not believe that means just death. But hatred too. One act of kindness has ripples around the world. Imagine the ripples you'd create from saving someone from the hate inside them. They could have child that you saved from yeaes of watching their parent be consumed by hate. You'd have changed that childs entire future. Remember there is another way. Great men like Darryl Davis have proved this. And other men have proven even the worst can become great like Chrisitian Picciolini. I'll link their Ted Talks below. 

Peace should always be first. 
If you think this was aimed at you it probably was. But know it isn't just you. It is the world. Technology has brought us together while it has divided us. I'm not sure if anyone will read this far. But if you did thanks. And no I'm not debating any of this. If you don't like it remove me. I won't stop advocating for peace before violence and I won't stop advocating for talking to our enemies. 

Thank you for reading. Plus Ultra.

You can&amp;#39;t fight ignorance with force. You can defend from it with force. But you cannot fight it with force. That only makes it worse. Talk to someone. Find common ground. Show them a different way. Don&amp;#39;t just be the bigger person be the better person. Save someone from their hate. Don&amp;#39;t just hate them. There is enough violence and hatred in this world. We don&amp;#39;t need to add to it. We can be kind and we can be gentle and we can I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fucking crying now because the pain in the world is so fucking much and I see people at each others throats and I don&amp;#39;t know what to say or what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix it. I just want to make the world a better place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great proverb I believe from Islam that I really like. &amp;quot;Take a human life and it is as if you&amp;#39;ve killed all of humankind. Save a human life and it is as if you&amp;#39;ve saved all of mankind.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that means just death. But hatred too. One act of kindness has ripples around the world. Imagine the ripples you&amp;#39;d create from saving someone from the hate inside them. They could have child that you saved from yeaes of watching their parent be consumed by hate. You&amp;#39;d have changed that childs entire future. Remember there is another way. Great men like Darryl Davis have proved this. And other men have proven even the worst can become great like Chrisitian Picciolini. I&amp;#39;ll link their Ted Talks below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace should always be first. 
If you think this was aimed at you it probably was. But know it isn&amp;#39;t just you. It is the world. Technology has brought us together while it has divided us. I&amp;#39;m not sure if anyone will read this far. But if you did thanks. And no I&amp;#39;m not debating any of this. If you don&amp;#39;t like it remove me. I won&amp;#39;t stop advocating for peace before violence and I won&amp;#39;t stop advocating for talking to our enemies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. Plus Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;

ANYWAY my new(ish) coworker is an idiot. Straight up. I feel terrible for saying it because he’s not a bad dude. But lately, I’m losing it. 

During our down time, he will sit in the back room, where we all sit, and listen to Minecraft play throughs at full volume.

I WILL KILL YOU.” because he put some in his coffee. HIS COFFEE. He also talks to himself loudly, to the point where customers ask if I am safe. 

Several times today, I have corrected him on how to put things away, how to hang things up, where they go, etc. I have had to go behind him repeatedly to fix whatever I just told him to do. 

This next incident is the final straw. He drinks a gallon of water every shift, so he goes to the restroom a lot. Obviously. He also watches videos while he pees.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journalist talking about a Paralympic champion who is about to die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: that’s so sad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: well it was to be expected months earlier, it’s not that big a deal, nobody cares &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: jokes about my ‘potential kids’ and how they will never be able to speak any language (I don’t talk much around others)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: adds to joke (It’s one of those joke chains where you keep on adding to a joke)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: OP doesn’t want kids so what you’re saying is bullshit &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mood is complete ruined, and I told her that once 4 years ago
(not in secrecy). She always brings it up whenever my parents talk about anything related to kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: &lt;em&gt;zaps around the tv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: you guys want to see this series?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: like we haven’t watched that already a thousand times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: well what do you propose we watch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: anything but that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: this movie? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: we’ve also seen that movie thousands of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: but aren’t you watching a movie on you phone right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: &lt;em&gt;stays angry for the rest of the evening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: &lt;em&gt;joking&lt;/em&gt; maybe when you get accepted into to that part time job you can sneak us some food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: I don’t like you joking about it, it’s not funny&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: ok, sorry &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: you forced me into this shit &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: no we didn’t, it was your own choice &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis: no, you pressured me into this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The ‘pressure’ she was talking about was my mother showing her one article about an open job application)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom: sorry &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be the guy who always says: ‘what I would’ve done...’ but.. what I would’ve done is to say to my sister: ‘well it’s your own choice, if you didn’t want to apply then don’t apply, mom and dad won’t go berserk on you’. My mom and dad do want her to have a job because on weekends and vacation days she sleeps from around 4 am to 1 pm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nobody cares is her favourite combination of words and I hate it so much. It shows that you think your opinion is better, and you can’t just let people like what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm from the UK. I have friends who live near me that I most probably won't be allowed to see, and a girlfriend who lives in Scotland with her parents at this time. I ought to tell her that she should stay up there for good, and never return home where we used to spend time together.

I despise the politicians that tell us one thing and do another. It insults me when they flip flop between loosening and tightening restrictions and give us mixed messaging in the process. This mixed messaging breeds mistrust, which breeds resentful individuals such as myself.

This will be a perpetual existence.  It's this simple: Stay in and Live, or go out and die.   

Those in power will never relinquish their emergency powers, allowing for full agency over us, as well as a licence for a transfer of wealth and power to the elites. Social life as we knew it has already gone. Now we will disconnect with one another.

1. They used particle board for all the shelves, the bottoms, and the backing. Not plywood like a decent human being or boards like a god, but your standard glue and sawdust particle board that absorbs everything right away and is a pain to clean.  

2. The supports in the pantry style cabinet are not placed properly.  It might be due to the particle board warping but there are gaps between the wooden supports and the actual walls of the cabinet.  Just what these garbage cabinets needed, another place for spiders and bugs to live in.  There is also gaps between the shelves and the cabinet back too but what did I expect.

3. The width of the drawers and cabinets are irregular at best. The drawers are between 16 and 17 inches but standards are for 17.5 inches.  How much effort is it going to take to line these things now.  Normally I'm fine not lining them but again its godforsaken particle board.

4. There is wiring going through the cabinets.  There are little cabinets above the refrigerator and stove that apparently have electrical outlets.  They decided to take dollar store circular LED lights and install them on the underside of the cabinets.  They then ran the power cords through the cabinets to get them power. I have not seen these lights work or a switch for them or even a reason why they exist.

5. The cabinets are sometimes deep.  This island is 4 feet across and the cabinets go the full depth.  Not the end of the world right?  Too bad they are one sided so you need to reach through that whole island if stuff is in the back.  There are a few shelves like this too. The pantry is about 3 feet deep, and there is a corner cabinet that goes sideways for the depth of the other side.  I had to get on the counter and use a tool to fish stuff out of there.  What about the drawers where you can easily get to the back? Nope, all normal depth there.  Why not make it the same?

6.  There is a random ass gap.  The corner cabinet I just mentioned has a 2 inch gap running along the seam where it joins the other side.  This is only on the bottom but come on.

Just what these garbage cabinets needed, another place for spiders and bugs to live in.  There is also gaps between the shelves and the cabinet back too but what did I expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The width of the drawers and cabinets are irregular at best. The drawers are between 16 and 17 inches but standards are for 17.5 inches.  How much effort is it going to take to line these things now.  Normally I&amp;#39;m fine not lining them but again its godforsaken particle board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is wiring going through the cabinets.  There are little cabinets above the refrigerator and stove that apparently have electrical outlets.  They decided to take dollar store circular LED lights and install them on the underside of the cabinets.  They then ran the power cords through the cabinets to get them power. I have not seen these lights work or a switch for them or even a reason why they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cabinets are sometimes deep.  This island is 4 feet across and the cabinets go the full depth.  Not the end of the world right?  Too bad they are one sided so you need to reach through that whole island if stuff is in the back.  There are a few shelves like this too. The pantry is about 3 feet deep, and there is a corner cabinet that goes sideways for the depth of the other side.  I had to get on the counter and use a tool to fish stuff out of there.  What about the drawers where you can easily get to the back? Nope, all normal depth there.  Why not make it the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a random ass gap.  The corner cabinet I just mentioned has a 2 inch gap running along the seam where it joins the other side.  This is only on the bottom but come on.  They couldn&amp;#39;t even keep their mistakes limited to the inside and had to show off their incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I understand that people advertise. I don't mind that. If you have a famous director or star in the film/show, use them. But when you just use general terms like woman, alphabet gang member, or something similar, that is something different.

One is using a single person's work as validation for quality that they do while the other is just a ploy to get attention.

I understand this mindset of “Give me praise for doing what all good parents do” usually comes from someone who themselves didn’t have a good parent, but they’re an adult now, and frankly they need to grow up. 

We cannot enable that mindset, because it perpetuates the myth that having good parents is a privilege. So don’t act offended when we don’t pretend to be impressed. 

Kids do not choose to be born. Having good parents is a right. If you do anything less than create a safe, healthy, *happy* childhood for them, you are a failure. 

That last part is often lost on people. They think doing things to make their kids’ life enjoyable is some kind of Superman move. Nope. It’s the job.

I am going to preface this by saying I am not religious. My stance is I don’t fucking care what happens to me when I’m dead because I’m dead and whatever religion is true or false I can roll with it even if I’m going to “hell” because hopefully a good god wouldn’t actually send someone there unless they were really bad and I’m alright ya know. Whatever, I’ll burn that bridge when I come to it. 

Anyway, despite that stance I have had many, many people try to convert me to some religion. Mainly Christian’s ngl. Who, when I ask questions like “does your church believe in evolution?” Say shit like “Adam and Eve and everyone else is wrong. I didn’t come from a monkey! You’re going to hell if you believe that, don’t stray from god/the bible!” 

And 1. I won’t start believing in that because I believe in science but why can’t they exist as one? The bible was written in context of the time it was written. 2000 years ago right? (Could be wrong oops) doesn’t matter our society has still changed so, so much and many things just aren’t true anymore. 

The bible supports slavery but here we are, few countries left have em but it’s still widely accepted as bad. The bible believes women has their place and should always serve their husbands and basically exist only to give offspring, and that’s also all kinds of fucked. And we know that the bible can and has been changed since it’s Hebrew text, like when in the 1940’s (I think) they added in homosexual even tho they knew the word meant young boy instead of man. Clearly the people in power using religion to control people, so why give it so much validity???

As times change we know the bible in it’s true is be unreliable, least I know. But why can’t god have created the Big Bang? Why can’t he/she/they have meant us to discover more about our world? Instead of letting god purely exist in the unknown why couldn’t they have intended us to look? Discover history, discover what he made billions of years ago? Because a lot of the bible is just stories, true and not true. There could have been Mary and Joseph and Jesus irl at one point. Do I think blond blue eye Jesus is real? Lol no he’s from the Middle East. But he could have existed and genuinely helped a lot of people. Idk about walking on water and all the cliche magicy things but they could have an explanation more than just “God have him power to do that”. 

I have a lot of questions n stuff that sway my opinion on the bible specifically. And In the end no one will convert me to things but I do genuinely want to know why people are so dead set on these beliefs. Is it just because of generational trauma? A cult like following where questions get you punished? Never were given the safe place to ask?

Recently, I was a victim of the so called 'asian/covid hatred' that's been going on, nothing severe happened in terms of physical harm, but rather a bunch of racial slurs and swearing for no apparent reason aside from racial hatred. Nonetheless, this pushed me over the edge to share my story.

I was born in Chicago IL, and have lived here my entire life (23 years). When I was a kid, I was never the victim of bullying, but always felt racially belittled by other people. I soon came to brush it off and assumed that this was normal. For example, I vividly remember a 6th grader come up to me-- I was in 4th grade at the time-- and say, 'Hey! I love China, do you like eating dog?', as the guy jokingly brushes it off. I'm not Chinese... I'm Korean. Even if I was Chinese, seriously? the F? This is a mild example of my daily childhood, and although I never received the same level of racial profiling as our black brothers and sisters (especially during recent times), I grew up thinking that these problems were normal, and that I could never bring this up because it never posed any 'real' problems in my day to day life. To be fair, I fully understand that it's not nearly the same situation, but looking back as a 23 year old young adult, it does make a bit sad and disappointed.

Unlike most terrible acts of racism we see on the news today, the story of my racism was a growing pain. Something that I've been conditioned to accept, a numbing pain I've endured for years but just came to realize it now. 

Now, as an adult, I have more a voice in terms of talking back to these racist bitch ass piece of shits, but subconsciously, I still have a voice of insecurity due to the way I've lived these past 23 years. So, out of genuinely curiosity, for other non-asian Americans out there-- what do you really think when you see an Asian American like me? Do you have a subconsious bias?

You’d think with millions more working from home it’d be a bigger issue. I was thinking about having to pay for my own internet and phone internet and shit got me heated so thanks for reading y’all.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a back story 
 (I'm 20 years old btw, there's only 6 people in my family, no kids, just adults)

My grandmother had dementia. My grandfather died last year, and my grandmother's dementia got terribly bad. She was still able to move and such,  up until this last Wednesday. 

She asked and signed for no hospice apparently. So she was really suffering. The Power of attorney,  my aunt  S, decided to go on vacation knowing that my grandmother was doing VERY badly. But decided to go on VACATION to the great wolf lodge (a 2 hour drive for them), knowing she was extremely sick. When my mother came over to check on my grandmother, they found her laying on her bed, hadn't used the bathroom in her diaper for 24 hours, ans hadn't eaten anything at all. She found out that my aunt was feeding my grandmother cupcakes and trash food. She was obviously neglected. 
When my mom told her that she was very sick, and most likely going to die, my aunt S said ""well here's the funeral number,  in case. And sorry I can't leave I can't get a refund for this vacation"". I was LIVID to say the least.  Now listen my grandmother wasn't able to eat, drink, open her eyes, or even talk. She would just scream in pain all day.
My mom was there all week helping her, ans slept there with her too. On Friday night when my aunt came back from vacation, she stormed in, kicked my mother out of the house, called the Paramedics, stole my grandmother's pills, and my grandmother died in the ambulance.  Bc moving someone who has been sleeping for 4 days and hasn't moved is going to KILL HER TO MOVE HER.

I got into a huge argument with my aunt. At the funeral home everyone was arguing. We went over to my grandmother's house today and everything is gone of any value. All my grandmother's jewelry, all her money , everything.
I had to comfort my mom who just lost HER mom.
I called my aunt and decided to yell at her. I was so beyond angry. She told me all these mean things and lied to my face. Whatever. But I get a call from her husband, who was threating me for arguing with my aunt. He told me ""I will go to jail.for my family so arguing with her and see where that gets you"".

Started drawing a few years ago, then that wasn't enough so I started painting.  Oh and I collect a ton of stupid stuff.

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE STOP ME FROM BUYING A SKATEBOARD!?!?!?!?

&lt;p&gt;i learned everything i possibly could i improved on anything i can he had to have been a pc player because no way he just destroys decent to good players in seconds with no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to take in is i don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time i typically can get at least 4 to 6 hours in on minecraft then i&amp;#39;m done since i have work and i&amp;#39;m at my peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyways how am i supposed to compare to some 14 year old kid who spends 17 hours on the game daily is hyper and aggressive ass fuck and plays on minecraft 24/7  while i get 4 hours on the dot and have no room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant," Hi all.  I am a 32 year old male and  have lived my whole life in a small town.  When I say small town I mean  like 250 people small.  No fast food, no Walmart, no theater, nothing.   All of these things are an hour away.  The nearest medium sized city is 3  and half hours.  I have been reflecting recently on how growing up here  has affected my social/dating life.  Don't get me wrong, I have friends  and I love them.  But we are all quite different.  We have fun when we  hang out but we don't have a lot in common.  Everyone here just  basically drinks alcohol.  That's really the only thing anyone does.  I  don't drink, so that leaves me out quite often.  My closest friend  actually doesn't drink much at all, but more on him later.  I see  everyone around here wasting away doing the same thing week in and week  out.  They post themselves on social media holding up (insert alcoholic  drink) every single weekend.  I am not against partying by any means but  it seems to be all anyone here has going for them.  A lot of them will  drink heavily every night.  It seems to be what people do here to cope  with their problems and small town boredom.  Quite a few move on to hard  drugs.

Now onto my best friend.   We are quite close.  But he is married and has a baby due in May.  I'm  happy for him and his wife who is also a friend of mine.  But I know  this means our friendship is about to change majorly.  I already don't  see him much at all anymore, even though I can walk to his house in like  5 minutes.  We went from hanging out every night to maybe seeing each  other once every few weeks.  I get it, his wife and his kid will always  be more important than me, as they should be.  But in my tiny town, he  is all I have.  There is nowhere for me to meet anyone else to hang out  with.  No one here shares my interests and everyone my age is already  married and/or settled down with kids.  I still talk to my best friend  everyday online but I think it's time for me to branch out and find new  people.  Sadly, that's next to impossible here.

Another  big issue I have is being gay.  Now, when I say issue I don't mean that  I get discriminated against.  Most of my friends know and are more than  accepting.  I know not everyone in a small town is so fortunate.  My  biggest problem is the lack of a dating scene.  There are like 4 openly  gay men within an hour of here and I'm not attracted to any of them.   Not to sound shallow, they're just not my type.  I basically have to  drive almost 2 hours to find anything.  And not drinking makes dating in  the gay community even more difficult.

I  can't help but think how my life would be if I grew up in a bigger area  with more options and opportunity.  I hate that I waited so long, but I  do plan on getting out very soon.  I'm dying inside here.  I want to be  somewhere where I can meet people like me.  I understand that some  people love the small town life, but it's not for me.  It's killing me.

,rant,"**Introduction:**

I'm a first year PhD student at an engineering university in the USA. Despite the rigorous course load, I like to enjoy my spare time playing video games. Video games are one of the great joys of life, in my opinion. FPS games are something I got into three years ago, and I might play 20 hours a week when I have slow weeks, or 0 hours most weeks when I'm busy with school work. These past two semesters have been hell for me as far as workload, but I was able to find a few hours last week and decided to hop on Valorant after a 7 month hiatus.

I played 20 unranked matches, decided to play ranked, and placed Iron 3. Yes, I know, I'm bad. I accept that I'm bad. I played Kovaak's for a long while, and am much better now than I was three years ago, and tbh, I always try my best. No matter what. And for me at least, that's what counts. While playing Iron 3, I continually ranked near the top of my team, however, like most people, some days are a bit worse than others.

I wanted to mention that I always try to be a team player. I'm always supportive, never toxic. I always say nice try to my teammates who are close to winning a round. I always do what others ask, whether its to smoke in a certain place, camp in a certain place. I'm not a pushover, but I try to be a team player. I always buy when I have the cash, and grab guns off the ground that people say the want. Hell, I even apologize when I just barely miss being able to grab that operator off the ground before the round ends.

**Where it beings:**

But over the past few days, playing in comp, if I have even a slightly bad round, I get told a number of things that quite frankly are extremely hurtful. I've been called a fcking rtard numerous times, in addition to the myriad of other aggressive insults. I've been told to uninstall the game. I've been told to go kill myself, by a group of 3 people that queued together.

The last one was because I was camped near site on a 2v1 (us two) and there was someone heaven. I tried to guard one entrance, the opponent came through the other and killed my teammate, my teammate yelled ROTATE and I started rotating one second after they yelled ROTATE. I got the opponent for 110 damage, got killed, we lost the round. While I was playing poorly that game, I don't think that round was my fault. But yet, I was told to kill myself, called a fcking rtard, and bullied by the 3 people that queued together. To add to the injury, they were telling the opposing team that I was throwing in the chat. And accusing me of having a mental breakdown for objectively and rationally defending myself while they went on with their insults. They are telling me to play unranked if I am so bad, but I don't think they realize that ranked puts me with people who are of similar skill rank.

**Conclusion:**

In short, I come to this game looking for fun. I first played it in beta for a few weeks, and I really enjoyed the game. I never played CSGO, and this was a fun experience for me. I always come to this game in a good mood, ready to have fun make the most of the time I have. I'm positive, both towards the game and towards my teammates. But all I do is get shit on the moment I play even slightly poorly one game. Better yet, I've even been shit on when I was on the top of my team.

Well, to all those cyberbullies who thought it would be okay to scream ""UNINSTALL the GAME  you fcking retard. Never play this game again"" well, I might come back, but I guess you're getting the first part.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this to be honest. Perhaps as an outlet. Or perhaps to wish that anyone seeing this can be a little kinder to someone who isn't as good as you wished they were. Unless you are in the top 0.01% of all players, there is little financial implication in this for you, so why ruin someone else's day over a game, especially when the outcome of this game is something that you will neither remember nor care about even two days from now?

Thanks to those that read this. I'm not looking for sympathy per se, nor do I intend to karma farm, but I hope some of you can understand, and not make my already crappy-feeling day worse.

**tl;dr** try my best, am always positive, get told to kill myself and get called names far too often.

**Edit: Just realised the title sounds like I'm gong to kill myself. I'm definitely not. I just feel frustrated.**

\----------------------------------------

It has been almost a year since I've seen my girlfriend due to travel bans in and out of Australia and the UK. I don't know when I'll next see her.

I haven't seen another human apart from my parents in several months now, except occaisionally shouting to my brother from my bedroom window.

I'm so sick of working out in the freezing UK winter.

I'm sick of spending 23 hours a day in my room.

I'm angry at my self for even feeling this way, when I've got a good job and so many people have been made unemployed and homeless.

I'm angry that the world seems to be getting worse, more divided, more ecologically and economically broken in my lifetime. I used to go to so many protests and be part of political groups but I feel like I made fuck all difference. What's the point when the rich and powerful just get exponentially more rich and powerful every year and do whatever the fuck they want to the rest of us.

I'm angry that my plant died.

I'm angry that every engagement with any idea means ""choosing a side"" and being hated by people who chose the other side.

I'm sick of walking up and down the same few streets for a year now. I'm sick of not seeing my friends.

&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been almost a year since I&amp;#39;ve seen my girlfriend due to travel bans in and out of Australia and the UK. I don&amp;#39;t know when I&amp;#39;ll next see her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen another human apart from my parents in several months now, except occaisionally shouting to my brother from my bedroom window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so sick of working out in the freezing UK winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of spending 23 hours a day in my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry at my self for even feeling this way, when I&amp;#39;ve got a good job and so many people have been made unemployed and homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry that the world seems to be getting worse, more divided, more ecologically and economically broken in my lifetime. I used to go to so many protests and be part of political groups but I feel like I made fuck all difference. What&amp;#39;s the point when the rich and powerful just get exponentially more rich and powerful every year and do whatever the fuck they want to the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry that my plant died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry that every engagement with any idea means &amp;quot;choosing a side&amp;quot; and being hated by people who chose the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of walking up and down the same few streets for a year now. I&amp;#39;m sick of not seeing my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m of how fucking happy and smiley the hosts of breakfast TV are. Yeah its easy for you to say we&amp;#39;re all in this together when life is so fucking great for you.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"Since about 2013\~2015, I feel like we are devolving as a species and here's why:

1. Politics being shoved down our throats everyday - It seems like 99.9% of anything we do has to have something and/or somewhat to do with politics. I mean, you can not walk into almost any social media platform without hearing stuff about politics. Even most art made in these times is not immune to this invasion of unnecessary politics. Sure, there have been and still are great pieces of art/media that deal with politics and political themes in the past and present like Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Shrek but it seems like most media/art (at least in the West) these days has to be a political lecture of some sort. I am looking at you, Disney Star Wars, Steven Universe, the CCP and genocide worshipping dumpster fire that is Disney's Mulan remake, and Netflix's dreaded piece of MAP propaganda known as Cuties..... And it also seems like the human race (again, especially in the West) has transformed into a politically-polarized mess who whine and argue over even the littlest of things.
2. Cancel culture - Man, I can not stand cancel culture. I honestly feel ashamed to be a part of Generation Z as I feel like most Generation Z-ers and most people who work in Western entertainment are wimps who get triggered by, offended by, and want to censor even the smallest of things they don't like or the smallest of disagreements. Don't they forget that we live in a free society and not in a communist/fascist one?! And you know that cancel culture has gotten way so out of hand that they've even recently targeted Dr. Seuss! For Arceus's sake, his books were made in a different time! So, please stop trying to destroy history and/or sabotage people's careers like they did to Gina Carano's and Spike Spencer's (yes, a white guy voice acting an East Asian boy is apparently not 'woke' enough for our modern sensibilities so in the Netflix redub of Evangelion, they replaced him with Johnny Yong Bosch, a real East Asian voice actor)!
3. Bland and boring technology - Smartphones and tablets are good and useful and all but I miss when technology had charm, individuality, and life to it. I mean, it seems like almost every smartphone and tablet looks the exact same but with different colors and features. I'm also getting sick of high-end ones getting rid of features people actually use like the 3.5 mm headphone jack and possibly soon, from what I can tell from rumors, the charging port. Even computers, laptops, tv's, and gaming systems are getting stagnant and samey but at least in the case of computers and laptops, it isn't as much as a problem as it is with smartphones and tablets. Heck, you can even build your own unique PC computer if you want to. However, generally speaking, I feel like we are running out of ideas for tech devices at this point. Even the performance increases they've gained in the past couple of years seems rather stagnant compared to even what it was throughout the 2000's. At this point, it seems like Gordon Moore was wrong, we haven't seen much of an increase in transistors since at least 2014 or so.
4. overly simplified and lazy design - Don't get me wrong. Simple design can be good if done right. However, it seems like throughout the past couple of years, designs for logos, UIs, cartoon characters, mascots, packaging, websites, etc. have become way too simplified, bland, and flat for their own good. Just look at Funimation or example. Their old logo was great. It was very iconic and eyecatching with the red ball and blue background. And their current logo, not so much. It's just an overly simplified purple :D face emoji. That's all it is. No ball, no background, just that dumb purple :D smiley emoji and Funimation in a sorta 2009 Nickelodeon logo-esque font. Another example of simplified design at it's worst would be the character designs of Thundercats Go and many other modern American cartoons. Just look at the 80's Thundercats and now look at Thundercats Go. It seems like all the characters are fat noodles with chubby smiles and black and white eyes now. And please do not get me started on the ""Corporate Art Style"" used by many tech companies like Google and Facebook.... What even are they? They just all look like ugly deformed hybrids between Muppets and wacky-waving inflatable arm-flailing tube-men to me. And that's sad.
5. a constant stream of bad, unoriginal, and downright greedy movies, tv, music, and video games - Sure, there will always be good and bad pieces of media whenever and wherever you go and there have been a couple diamonds in the rough when it comes to 2013\~present media (like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, Deadpool, Frozen, Frozen II, Pacific Rim, Pacific Rim: Uprising, Ready Player One (the movie, I've never read the book yet as of typing), Pokemon: Detective Pikachu (the movie, I've never played the game yet as of typing), Sonic the Hedghog (2020), Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: Reflection, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: Detonation, Million Arthur: Arcana Blood, Puyo Puyo Champions, certain K-pop songs (especially those from BTS, Dreamcatcher, GFriend, Twice, and Loona), Vivid Strike!, etc.) but it seems like in the past couple of years the bad has overwhelmedly overshadowed the good. Hollywood movies seem to be mostly superhero movies and bad remakes/reboots/sequels/prequels/midquels/adaptations/reimaginings of previously established properties, TV is mostly filled with reality tripe, preachy politics, annoying news, and terrible Hallmark and Lifetime movies, most music is basically generic play-by-the-numbers pop and Soundcloud rappers who have a superiority complex, and video games are mostly bland large-scale open world games and glorified DLC/microtransaction/season pass/battle pass-filled casinos with gameplay, nuff said. Also, please do not get me started on streaming. Almost none of major streaming services' originals are worth watching anyways.

So, overall, I believe circa 2013\~present, especially the past year or so have been awful to me so far.

2 years ago she told me she's getting a couch, I asked if she wants to split the bill and she declines. Initially she was worried the cats would scratch up the corners like the old couch. On the day the couch is getting picked up by scrap pickup, she asked me to help her move the couch out front. The pick up was 12:30 pm, but she asked me to move it around 11:00 am. I asked her what's the rush, she said I just wanna get rid of it and I said ok. As we were moving it she got anxious and stressed somehow and rushed me even more, I was pulling she was pushing. I asked her to slow down, but didn't listen, I was losing grip and asked to put it down momentarily and at that moment my right hand was slammed on a doorway, I dropped my side of the couch. She kept pushing even though I was on the way, I was nursing my hand and she kept pushing the couch out of the building. She came back and didn't even apologize. I was so angry I wanted to bash her head through the wall. Instead, I left the apartment got some ice for my hand and cathartically let my anger out somewhere else. When the new couch came in, it doubled or tripled the anger that I felt from before. She started telling me that ""I didn't know it that couch was this big"", I then asked the following questions; Didn't you see it in store?, Did you measure its dimensions? Was there a model in the store similar you can look at? All her answers were NO. She said I bought it without knowing the specifics, because the sales person said it would work for what she was looking for. After she said that I left quietly, to cool off. 

From that point, I'm convinced that I will never like this person. I let things slide because she explained to me that she suffers from depression, anxiety and she easily gets stressed. Within a year of living with her she was in a car accident that heightened her conditions. I saw her go through a lot, with her recovery and mental condition. So I was cautious whenever I interact with her. Right now it looks like she's unaware of how she's treating me. I don't want to talk to her about it because I know me and I will hurt her ""precious"" feelings and also I might get really angry and do something I can't take back.

,rant,"Gotta rant about this:

Like a lot of other people, I jumped on the sourdough bread bandwagon in quarantine. I've actually gotten pretty good at it, with decent looking loaves. I don't have a fancy bread machine to knead it, so I make it all by hand.

For Thanksgiving, since the extended family couldn't gather to celebrate, I decided to bake a bunch of loaves for family members to enjoy at their own mini-dinners.

One uncle in particular fell in love with my bread and has been dropping hints that he wanted more bread ever since. Last week he finally asked me directly to bake some for him, and he would even pay for it.

Now, I'm a crafty type of gal, but I generally dont like taking 'orders' for the things I make. It stresses me out and makes me feel obligated to do things when there's money on the line because 'you cant turn down making money!' Factor in the fact that when it comes to handmade items, the mass public expects the 'price' of the item to be a lot lower than the amount of time and effort actually put into it. Like, if I like you, and I'm particularly inclined, yeah, I'll do it, but on my own timeline, and just as a happy surprise for you, you know? 

But anyway, he orders 10 loaves and I'm like ok, fine, only because I know I'll get grief from my mom and grandma if I turn him down. The amount he offers is like... cost of materials and a hefty lunch at a fastfood place, but like, seriously, whatever. Hes family, and I can take a little low-balling for family, especially considering I'm not some artisan baker, and I wouldn't mind baking for him under other circumstances. 

10 loaves is a lot to knead and make, so I plan it out. Juggling things in and out of the fridge, baking one batch one day, and the next batch the following day. Package everything up nice, etc. All told, it takes about 2 days of kneading, rising, shaping, baking, etc. etc. (And yeah, maybe someone else could do that, some super master-class level baker no problem, but I'm a novice working in a tiny kitchen damnit)

He was supposed to pick this shit up yesterday morning, and its today afternoon and I just want this shit to be GONE ALREADY. He's not great about answering his texts, and the texts that he DOES answer are all misleading ""Just give me a couple hours, I'm be there soon!"" (Key note, hes not being proactive about reaching out to me, it's me bugging HIM about when he's going to pick this up)

I dont have enough fridge/freezer space to throw this shit in there, and I'm afraid it will go moldy or stale if I keep it out much longer. Handmade bread does not keep as long as store bought bread.

I'm so sick of people thinking that handmade stuff is like - disposable/should be cheap/isnt as much effort. Just because its a hobby for me, they don't have to take it seriously.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so sick of people thinking that handmade stuff is like - disposable/should be cheap/isnt as much effort. Just because its a hobby for me, they don&amp;#39;t have to take it seriously.

,rant,"Am I silly to be upset and sad about this?

Background: I’m (23 f) and have guy I’ve been seeing this (28 m) exclusively since like the end of November 2020. We’ve both been single for about year. We aren’t like “bf/gf” or taken anything to the next level, but are only seeing each other and enjoy each other’s company. I was in a previous 5 year toxic, unhealthy relationship. Whereas he was in a 7 year healthy, great, happy relationship for the most part I’m assuming. He has been open about it since the beginning that he still remains friends with his ex girlfriend and talks occasionally (even showing me some of their messages). Also like sending each other Christmas presents (which I find weird). I honestly think it is great and mature on his end that he is able to separate that and remain her friend as they were probably great friends. My issue is by everything I see she clearly isn’t over him. The ex girlfriend also does not live in the same state as us. 

Well this past week the ex girlfriend reached out to him stating that she’s at a low point in her life, misses her best friend (I.e him), hates that he doesn’t talk to her often, and even suicidal.... 
 
So now as you imagine he’s been there for her as any friend should / would be. But he’s also been texting her everyday, to like check up on her and whatever. And yesterday she asked to come visit him at his apartment. Mind you she lives in a whole another state, so this would involve an airplane ride during a pandemic.... (?) 

He showed me her text asking to come visit and my issue is with his reaction. He didn’t immediately text her back per say, but he already knew his answer which was “absolutely yes! she needs me I’ll be here for her. She’s my friend and this has nothing to do with you”. Basically in his exact words to me. That’s what made me upset. I just personally feel like her stance sounds EXTREMELY manipulative on her end, but whatever. That’s also what bothers me. I didn’t mean to take it so personal. I get he had a whole another life before I met him. Idk my issue was he didn’t even really want to hear how I felt or want to know any questions I had. It’s not like we live together - I get it it’s his house he’s allowed to have whomever he likes visit. I guess it feels weird to me because I spend so much time there and have left some stuff there and the fact that he told me he would put it away / hide it for her. I just found stupid. Like I don’t get it.

I feel like I obviously am thinking WAY to much into it and regardless he will do whatever he wants. But am I silly to be upset about it since it’s really not my place? I just feel like the person he is seeing he shouldn’t have to hide from her to spare her feelings. (Like hiding my stuff when she comes over). I suggested she stay in a hotel next door to his apartment and that was a complete joke to him. 

Maybe the issue is with me. It’s not that I don’t trust him by any means. He’s been so open about her from the beginning. I just don’t like how she’s clearly not ever him and is so stoked to come hangout with him like ASAP. She’s sad he doesn’t talk to her enough.

But it doesn't only happen at school. I'm the middle child, and I heard this problem is common with middle children.

,rant,"The sad thing with this whole Dr. Seuss situation is that one of his most famous lines in a book is, ""A person's a person, no matter how small.""-  A line from Horton Hears a Who, written after Seuss visited Japan and saw the aftermath of the bombings. Suess wrote this book as a way to make amends with Japan for all his racial drawings and comics he drew during the war; a condolence as he realizes they too are equals and they too matter. 

Ironically, America is now upset because his corporation wants to remove books that contain pictures that portray the exact opposite. Pictures of a white male child holding a gun as he rides on a cage that three Asian men carry on their heads; a picture of a man holding a whip as an Asain man rides an elephant pulling him and many others along; and other degrading, stereotypical, and racist  images. 

Racism has no place in our future and ends now with us. Need I remind you of another Seuss quote, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not."" If we want racism to end, then we need to be the ones to take a stand and end it.  

The books weren't pulled for racist words and text, they were pulled for racist images. Honestly, just replace the pictures in the book and keep the original text- kids would never know.

,rant,"I’m disturbed over how cruel and indifferent some people, even those closest to you, can be.

A year ago, me (M17) and my friend (M17) and a few other people we know got threatening, creepy texts from random numbers, claiming to be the “blue whale” challenge, if you don’t know what it is it’s basically a challenge where you’re told to do a certain list of things, like drink a cup of water, self harm, and the final challenge is to take your own life. Anyway, we were both justifiably freaked out over this, we spent days talking about it, it seemed to disturb him just as much as it disturbed me. Some days passed and the texts stopped, my friend told me he found the person that was doing it, said he was a friend of a friend, he said he told him to stop and he complied. That was the end of that.

Fast forward a year later to yesterday, me and my friend were reminiscing about old memories over FaceTime and we brought up the time this happened, we laughed over it and remembered how scared we were, then coincidentally we both got random texts saying the same thing from before. We both freaked out again, but this time due to the ridiculous timing I knew it had to be him or related to him in some way. You might be thinking it’s just a prank and it’s not that serious, but the contents of the texts were very disturbing, and it’s how well he lied that got me, I’d like to consider myself a fairly intelligent person, and I can usually tell when someone’s lying. I had no clue it was him the first time around, he lied like it was absolutely nothing, it was so elaborate and believable that I genuinely believe he may be a psychopath because I’ve never seen anyone lie so well, and convey so many realistic emotions.

I came up with a clever trick to get him to reveal that it was him by accident and it worked. Once he realized what I had done, and I confronted him about it he got super mad and defensive, he told me I’m overreacting, that it’s not a big deal, that he didn’t care, he called me a few names, some slurs, brought up VERY personal things I’ve told him in the past and used them as an insult, told me I’m never going to amount to anything, etc. all of this was one sided, I just sat there in shock. This all came out of nowhere and I’m still somewhat in shock. Truly, there was no indicator anything like this would ever happen, me and him have been friends for 4 years and have done so much together. You reading this, imagine your best friend, who you’d have no reason to believe would randomly become toxic, suddenly turn against you and attack you like this one day. That’s basically what happened to me. It came out of nowhere.

Due to being online this entire school year (someone in my home is at-risk for covid so I can’t go to school), I lost most of my friends. He was one of my last true friends and he turned on me. I feel like my explanation doesn’t do what happened justice, I still feel very traumatized and I don’t know what I’m gonna do. Some of what he said still lingers in my mind and I can’t get it out, it just hurts different when it comes from someone you know very well, someone you’ve told so much to, someone that supposedly knows you very well and everything you’ve gone through. 

Not long before this happened a girl I liked a lot and talked to for a long time lead me on for 8 months, told me she liked me, and then eventually said “I didn’t actually mean it”, and then stopped talking to me. The worst part of all of this is I’m not the factor that’s causing this to happen to myself, I’m very self aware, I’m not weird or annoying, I’m kind to everyone I know. The fact that all these bad things can happen to me for literally no reason depressed me, it makes me want to stop. 

I think I may have trust issues for a very long time now, due to these instances happening in close proximity to each other.

,rant,"If I could move I would but money and up and moving where you have no network isn't an option. I'm currently being sued for fraudulent medical bills. I have called 50 lawyer offices and no one will help me. 

I'm not going into specific details because I don't want to be identified and this somehow used against me. Several years ago I had outpatient surgery at the local hospital. All doctors offices, medical providers, the hospital etc are owned by the same corporations. My mom worked there and alway I'd never seen a doctor out of this corporation (I was freaking born there). As long as I can remember they would file insurance for patients. When I was 18 obviously I was doing the doctor stuff on my own, but I was still on my moms insurance which although is a separate company is provided through her employer which is this corporation. So when I received several insane bills I asked my mom and she said she'd take care of it, and being it was her insurance and she worked for the corporation I believed her. So I never paid much attention to this stuff. Till right before the holidays. 

Right before the holidays my dad called me and said a policeman showed up and served a notice saying that I'm being sued by a provider who works for the corporation. (Note as I pointed out they're all the same corporation but different providers). I didn't get the paperwork for about a week. From the time my dad got the papers I had only 30days to file my plea or I was assumed guilty. Because of holidays all law offices were closed till about a week before the paperwork was to be turned in so no one would help me. At this point I've assumed I don't get the right to a lawyer and can't get one after the paperwork is filed. I was never given my rights, idk how the court system works, I've never even gotten a ticket. 

I had never received a bill for these people. I was not told they were a separate provider in my surgery (which was necessary because I was in pain, couldn't work, and the organ had to be removed before it ruptured). I was only informed that any separate provider will send me a bill, which I never received. I obviously start pulling up detailed bills, insurance EOB and doing all the research for not only this, but to see what else is going on with my medical stuff. Apparently I'm $35k in medical debt (no wonder I can't get a credit card). The provider suing me is suing me for over $5k alone. This surgery and another major medical problem I had we're never submitted at all from any provider. The main corporation already charged me for this service. I've also noticed on about 8 out of 10 bill to EOB comparisons the corporation is committing fraud by charging insurance more than what they say it is on my detailed bill (I can't remember the proper name at the moment, but the bill that shows the charge for each thing). That's insurance fraud. I've also caught several double charges and bills for things never received. I can't trust what anything this corporation bills me to be accurate so no I'm not going to make a payment plan or attempt to pay when I can't even ensure it's accurate. I have tried to fix it by calling their billing office and insurance. The billing office stands by everything is correct and refuses to help me. The insurance company stands by the fact that they never received a claim, and since it's been years I can't file one. In reading the signed contract with the corporation about billing they discuss things such as they'll directly receive the insurance money. Between statements like that and the fact they filed insurance on my behalf in the past, and after the ones they didn't file and that receptionists have told me they'll file it, along with my mom telling me that as an employee of them, clearly lead me to believe that filing it was a service they did. Therefore claiming they do not offer that is deception and therefore fraud. With them filing the insurance I'm not reliable for the fraud they have committed. 

Then the specific provider who is suing me is committing fraud by lying, and forging papers claiming they've filed. They are also lying about trying to contact me as the corporation has had my updated information, and I never received any contact. They can't say they didn't have access to this as they had access to my correct name (I got married). They also made contradictory claims that they are with the corporation and not with the corporation. The corporation also claims that they have sent it to collections, meaning if I'm sued I'll be getting charged for this service a 3rd time. 

So my court case came this week right? Went to court. Felt pretty confident as I had a strong case, but having a mental disorder I was having panic attacks the entire time. The only thing the judge said to me was ""you're claiming you never received a bill? You had the service you owe it."" He then allow the plaintiff to talk about all their claims. The judge then proceeded to just have a conversation in front of me with the plaintiff, even talking bad about me and insulting me. The judge ruled in favor of plaintiff, asked the plaintiff to fax over how much I owed, then stated ""that's all"" and waved us off the screen. I never even got to be heard. I feel so violated and discriminated against by this trial. Apparently I only have 30 days from that day to do an appeal and that may not even be approved. 

Since then I've prepared more evidence and have been looking up everything I can. I've called over 50 lawyers, but no one handles this kind of thing. Some advised me to get a civil defense lawyer because it's a civil defense case, but they tell me they can't help because it's a medical case, the medical lawyers say they can't help me because I'm being sued and involves money, so contact a bankruptcy lawyer, they can't help me because it involves medical stuff and fraud plus I'm actually trying to fight it so they suggest a fraud lawyer, fraud lawyer can't help me because I'm being sued they suggest a general practice lawyer, general practice lawyer can't help me because it's too specific. I've tried using reference cites, but they haven't helped either. 

I really hate this and feel helpless. Idk what to do I really just need a lawyer. I've gathered all the paperwork I can think of, made 4 copies of all of it. I've done everything I can think of. I even asked on legal advice on Reddit and mainly got ""well did you do this, this, and this"" and the answer is almost always yes. I'm only guilty of listening and believing my mom, who not only has handled my doctor stuff, but my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because she works there and that's probably a hippa violation in and of itself. 

I really hate this. Idk what else to do other than keep calling and emailing places. I wish we just had universal healthcare. Why do I need a lawyer to get medical care? I'm now too scared to go back to any doctors in the corporation so I refuse to and I am now awaiting my first appointment with a doctor over an hour away.. and to say I have several health problems that aren't my fault would be an understatement.",t2_72r9q08l,False,,0,False,I hate the US medical system it's so corrupt,[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_lzheb4,False,dark,0.7,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615113859.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could move I would but money and up and moving where you have no network isn&amp;#39;t an option.

I&amp;#39;ve also noticed on about 8 out of 10 bill to EOB comparisons the corporation is committing fraud by charging insurance more than what they say it is on my detailed bill (I can&amp;#39;t remember the proper name at the moment, but the bill that shows the charge for each thing). That&amp;#39;s insurance fraud. I&amp;#39;ve also caught several double charges and bills for things never received. I can&amp;#39;t trust what anything this corporation bills me to be accurate so no I&amp;#39;m not going to make a payment plan or attempt to pay when I can&amp;#39;t even ensure it&amp;#39;s accurate. I have tried to fix it by calling their billing office and insurance. The billing office stands by everything is correct and refuses to help me. The insurance company stands by the fact that they never received a claim, and since it&amp;#39;s been years I can&amp;#39;t file one. In reading the signed contract with the corporation about billing they discuss things such as they&amp;#39;ll directly receive the insurance money. Between statements like that and the fact they filed insurance on my behalf in the past, and after the ones they didn&amp;#39;t file and that receptionists have told me they&amp;#39;ll file it, along with my mom telling me that as an employee of them, clearly lead me to believe that filing it was a service they did. Therefore claiming they do not offer that is deception and therefore fraud. With them filing the insurance I&amp;#39;m not reliable for the fraud they have committed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the specific provider who is suing me is committing fraud by lying, and forging papers claiming they&amp;#39;ve filed. They are also lying about trying to contact me as the corporation has had my updated information, and I never received any contact. They can&amp;#39;t say they didn&amp;#39;t have access to this as they had access to my correct name (I got married). They also made contradictory claims that they are with the corporation and not with the corporation. The corporation also claims that they have sent it to collections, meaning if I&amp;#39;m sued I&amp;#39;ll be getting charged for this service a 3rd time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my court case came this week right? Went to court. Felt pretty confident as I had a strong case, but having a mental disorder I was having panic attacks the entire time. The only thing the judge said to me was &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re claiming you never received a bill? You had the service you owe it.&amp;quot; He then allow the plaintiff to talk about all their claims. The judge then proceeded to just have a conversation in front of me with the plaintiff, even talking bad about me and insulting me. The judge ruled in favor of plaintiff, asked the plaintiff to fax over how much I owed, then stated &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s all&amp;quot; and waved us off the screen. I never even got to be heard. I feel so violated and discriminated against by this trial. Apparently I only have 30 days from that day to do an appeal and that may not even be approved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve prepared more evidence and have been looking up everything I can. I&amp;#39;ve called over 50 lawyers, but no one handles this kind of thing. Some advised me to get a civil defense lawyer because it&amp;#39;s a civil defense case, but they tell me they can&amp;#39;t help because it&amp;#39;s a medical case, the medical lawyers say they can&amp;#39;t help me because I&amp;#39;m being sued and involves money, so contact a bankruptcy lawyer, they can&amp;#39;t help me because it involves medical stuff and fraud plus I&amp;#39;m actually trying to fight it so they suggest a fraud lawyer, fraud lawyer can&amp;#39;t help me because I&amp;#39;m being sued they suggest a general practice lawyer, general practice lawyer can&amp;#39;t help me because it&amp;#39;s too specific. I&amp;#39;ve tried using reference cites, but they haven&amp;#39;t helped either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hate this and feel helpless. Idk what to do I really just need a lawyer. I&amp;#39;ve gathered all the paperwork I can think of, made 4 copies of all of it. I&amp;#39;ve done everything I can think of. I even asked on legal advice on Reddit and mainly got &amp;quot;well did you do this, this, and this&amp;quot; and the answer is almost always yes. I&amp;#39;m only guilty of listening and believing my mom, who not only has handled my doctor stuff, but my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because she works there and that&amp;#39;s probably a hippa violation in and of itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hate this. Idk what else to do other than keep calling and emailing places. I wish we just had universal healthcare. Why do I need a lawyer to get medical care? I&amp;#39;m now too scared to go back to any doctors in the corporation so I refuse to and I am now awaiting my first appointment with a doctor over an hour away.. and to say I have several health problems that aren&amp;#39;t my fault would be an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

He was the best company I could ever ask for. My mother and I had sceptics about owning one with how busy we might or might not be. 
I named him Milo, then in November last year we had got another Chocolate Miniature daschound, my mother called him Max. 
Everything was fine last year before I started school a couple of weeks ago. Last year in year 8 I had little work and I had time to look after my dogs and spend time with them because they were something I could come home to. My mother's job worked out, I looked after them before she came home and she could come home to spend time with them herself. 

Then when I went into Year 9 this year, work hit me like a literal truckload. From the start of Week 1, I couldn't even spend a minute with them because of how much goddam homework I am being assessed, even after being assessed 7 assignments at one go. 

My mother and I felt so guilty and cruel to our boys for having to lock them up in a cage, it was a big one for them to play in and they had blankets, toys, water, shelter, biscuits, treats, you name it. But it had to be done otherwise they would be ran over or stolen. 

We gave them away yesterday afternoon.

Now we have had to give our dogs away because I can't look after them in the afternoon, they get too distracting and I can't get any work done.

My motivation gradually got worse, the fall was ok, I mostly got things done at least, slowly.

In secondary, I used to have this teacher (I’ll call him H) and at first he seemed great. He was my year 7 (age 11-12) DT teacher and I saw him as one of my favourite teachers at first. Everything was going hunky dorey until Christmas. 

At the end of the Christmas half term my form tutor (MG) announced she’d be leaving. Now I didn’t get a lot of time with MG as I barely ever saw her, but from what I can remember, she was ok, Nice enough. Who would replace her though? 

In one of those DT classes, I remember sitting at the back when H announced he would become our new form tutor. The whole class was originally overjoyed at this announcement but then shit hit the fan.

Later on in the year, and I wasn’t necessarily his biggest fan. He had clear favourites in the class and I was probably at the bottom of his ranking. My class wasn’t the best at behaving, and one day we were screaming and stamping down the stairs. Me and the boys weren’t involved, and just tried not to get caught up in the bad behaviour. Now our school was having stuff done to the roof, and scaffolding was up in some places around the school. As I walked out, another kid grabbed onto my bag and tried to pull me over. Reflexes took over, so I grabbed a scaffolding pole so I wouldn’t fall. Now I must add, the scaffolding was very clearly safe, as builders walked and carried heavy stuff up there all day. A teacher saw this, and was FURIOUS with ME! The kid who pulled me got away Scot free. I was made to go to head of year and luckily he actually realised the BS this was and let me go. 

That wasn’t even the end of it though. As he was my form tutor, H got wind of this, and eventually called me out for “dangerous behaviour” saying bullshit like the scaffolding could tumble and even though he KNEW about the other kid pulling me over. He refused to tell him off and swept it under the rug. He threatened to email home and luckily never did, but he seemed to hold a super grudge against me ever since.

A few months later, Summer was over and I had had a few brushes with H, but overall stayed out of trouble. That was until ‘BottleGate’. It was lunchtime and I was walking across school to get to a certain class block and I saw a massive crowd. I decided to investigate and look and behold, a bunch of year 11’s were standing there having a sort of competition. They punted a bottle and were seeing who could punt it furthest. Now I saw about 15 different year 11 s kick it, and as I made my way for the art block, they started singing a football (soccer) chant at me. It wasn’t mean or anything and I took it as a compliment as I looked like the football player they were chanting about.

And this is where i get the gem of a prize

A year 11 asked if I wanted a go, and I accepted. As I stepped back to kick they encouraged me and acted like I was one of their own. A medium sized crowd gavered all around me and they started cheering. I saw a few teachers look at me, and walk on, zero fucks given. I booted the bottle, with it going a decent distance as a large cheer erupted from the crowd. However, after this, H ran out looking angry as shit. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but he seemed extremely pissed off. As he forced me to walk off, a few of the year 11’s laughed as he said,
‘tHeY aRe LaUgHiNg At yOu NoT wITh YOUUUUU!’ 

Well of course they are, because YOU fucking walked me off mate.

He dumped me at head of year and said that I should ‘stay until I’m dismissed’. My head of year arrived and asked what I did so I told him. He seemed sort of confused as to why I was there and just told me to go. As I walked up to my form class, I looked in and saw him yelling and walking around angrily. My friends told me that he was saying how you ‘cant trust year 11s’ and ranting about me and how I can’t behave and shit.’ In dt he continuously gave me the evil eye. And said how he didn’t ‘want to hear me at all’. 

My parents thought it was ridiculous. And it was. But I got the last laugh. His threats of action, such as detentions and never came about and I got off Scott free, though I certainly believe my head of year played a part in this. As word got around, I was the hot topic of the week in yr 11. Fist pumps were a-plenty and I enjoyed my 5 minutes of fame.

Had an old dude come in today at work. He was a semi regular as I saw him, but not too often. He said he wanted a burger combo large. Never said onion rings to my knowledge. He gave me a $100 I guess to flex as I saw a $20 in his wallet? Wouldn’t surprise me. I had to get change since it was the start of my shift and I didn’t have enough 1s or 5s to give him his $88 change so I give him his drink and receipt and he sits down as I get change from the back.

- Wakes up starving cos I don't have any money to buy food

- Roommate tells me they're going out of town to get some errands done, so I ask if I can go with so that we can get some food.
Roommate agrees.

- At one of the places we stop at, a woman saw me solving my Rubik's cube (which I've been doing for almost 3 years now as a fun hobby) and tells me I need to stop touching my cubes and get a girlfriend.
As if I haven't been trying to get a date since I'm officially over Shy cheating on me, like everyone else does.

- When we get food, my roommate tells me that I'm super irresponsible with my money, despite the problem being that I've been out of work for over a month.
Specifically he's upset that I pre-ordered a board game called Dice Throne back in September even tho I should've been buying car parts instead.
Despite the fact that I was relatively okay in September, my car has stayed broken even after trying to fix it multiple times.
ALSO knowing that I plan on paying both of my roommates back for helping me out since I have been unemployed when I start getting paid again soon.
The other roommate has NOT been this mean to me about it.

- When I tell my roommate that I need to figure out how to get my gun rights restored after being TDO'd into a psych ward recently, he reminded me that my hospital bills need to be paid pronto.
Which is already overwhelming me as it is, as some of my friends already know cos I've actually reached out to a few of them about this.

- Also on the way back home, roommate starts to tell me that I'm also the reason why none of my dreams have come true, despite the fact that he knows that most people I've ever been in a band with turned out to be pieces of shit.
(Skipping band practice for pussy, unknowingly working with a pedo, etc.)
Saying things like ""You've had plenty of opportunities to start learning actual skills to build yourself up and start a business.""

- When we get home, he immediately leaves again.
My other roommate and I jump on a video game together that I've never played before, so I'm understandably bad at it.

- Literally all day long, I haven't been able to get what happened with me and Tommy out of my head.

I didn't provoke him for any of this, nor understand why the woman told me that I need to get a girlfriend instead of just letting me play with my Rubik's cube.
I don't know why he was in such a bad mood today and why he felt the need to take it out on me.
I'm constantly feeling lonely as it is and it's gotten to the point where it physically hurts.
And then with my roommate taking the piss out of me as much as he was today?

,rant,"Tl;dr: a rant about motherhood. It will likely bore you. 

My kids are 6 and 3. I'm so sick of it. Longest job I've ever held, and only because there isn't a quit option. I love my husband too much to just leave. I'd miss him too much. I'm just so damn sick of the mommy missiles. I'm so sick of never having a moment to myself. Everything revolves around me and I've spent my life doing everything I can to make everything NOT revolve even near me. I was constantly called clingy and needy because I wanted to talk with my partners every day, so I shut myself further and further into this state of making myself not needed or wanted. And now I can't even have a second of peace to sit here writing this post on the potty because there's 2 screaming children banging on the door. I just want them to go away. Not die, just go away. 

When I was 6, I hoped my mother would die. I am still waiting for that walking corpse to finally get in the ground and there's a good chance I'll never know about it. I remember screaming ""I hate you stupid"" and ""I hope you die"" at her at my daughter's age. I very shortly knew a woman a few years ago with a very sweet 3yo son, and she threw away something her son loved and he screamed ""you're such an idiot mom"" and she slapped him yelling ""don't you call me an idiot, you idiot."" Exactly how I was raised. My kids? ""I love you more than rainbows."" ""You're the best mom, mommy."" Me: why must you sit here touching me? ""Because I just want to be with you, I love you so much."" My daughter asked me to read from a book of questions and one of them was ""what always makes you smile"" and I figured it would be her toy or her friend and she says ""Your kisses make me smile every time, mommy."" When I make them a dinner they both love there is a chorus of ""you're the best, you're the greatest, we love you"" the entire fucking meal. 

Shut up, eat your food, and stop loving me so much! I can't wait until they are teenagers, take their dinner without asking a million questions about it which takes them hours to eat it and now it's cold so I have to warm it up, and never want to talk to me. All my older parent friends tell me how much it sucks that their teens NEVER want to talk to them, and how I should cherish every moment and I'm like... is there a way I can hurry this process? They hate their room. There's everything in there. And they have a huge yard with swings, a slide, sand pit, and a race track for their ""My First Tesla"" (funny grandma was mad we let the kids paint their own room, was told ""you wouldn't let them drive a car!"" Grandma, *you're* the one who literally bought them an electric vehicle, of course we let them drive a car and paint!). They don't want any of it, they want to find me anywhere I hide and complain how it's not exactly the way they want it and omg I just... I want to hurt them. Omg, you don't have the bounce house your friend has so your whole day is ruined... fuck you bitch, I didn't have ANY of what you have! I ate out of trash cans, was called stupid, worthless and unlovable daily, and I didn't even have a DADDY! Or a fucking sibling! I had nothing, no family, nothing but a bitch mother that moved us every year so I had no friends. Been around the world and I hated every second. Even through the pandemic my daughter has used my phone to video chat her friends more than I've used my phone for anything else! I'm doing everything I can to keep my children's lives stable as we try to find our way as adults. And all my kids can do is complain. They have more blood family on their dad's side than people I have called ""friends"" in my entire life. And still ""I wish I had..."" I wish you'd shut your fucking mouth and just be thankful! Every fucking present under that Christmas tree was for my kids this year, 30+ of them, from the whole family,  they were all wrapped with bows, some with ""from Santa"" and even though we had covid and were isolating, family AND friends showed up and stood at the street while we opened gifts on the porch. When I was a kid, I got a gift (often panties) wrapped in a shopping bag and was imprisoned in my house for the day because ""it's a family holiday.""

I would have given anything to be alone in my room as a kid. Just get me away from my mother! But no, she never let me close my door, she hunted me down, forced me to go out with her. She told me she hopes my kids turn out like I was. Hahahahahaha, bitch please! I hope my kids turn out like me too! If they want nothing to do with me in the same fashion as I wanted nothing to do with her, I'd be overjoyed! I'd finally have the chance to go outside and take a fucking WALK! But no, I can't go for a walk because then I feel guilty so I spend 45 min getting the kids ready for a 10 min walk around the block that is stressful as fuck. So I don't go out. Today is gorgeous, I'll spend it inside because they are stressful to take anywhere. 

I fully admit I wasn't prepared for this. I was expecting them to be like I was, hide away in their room to play together. I would have given anything for a sibling! And all they do is fight! Wtf? I've been told this is normal for siblings, but why? If you piss off your sibling who will play with you? And why always me!? Why can't I have a week to myself? I haven't had more than a couple of hours without my kids since they were born. I have dreams, I have things I want to do, I used to be an artist. Now every one of my art books is destroyed with scribbles and not one pencil is safe, even on the highest shelf! I can't write, can't read, can't draw, can't play video games because it's constant ""mommy mommy mommy mommy mommy"" screaming through the house. And yes, hubby helps, but only so far as to let me shower, nap or get chores done, but not for the rest of life. How come I can find plenty of family to watch them for an 8 hour rat race job but I can't find a moment of peace for something I actually want to do that could make me just as much if I had any one who had some faith in it? 

You know how long it's taken me to write this? Over 4 (now 5) hours now. A couple.... of words at a.... time because I turn ar... ound and there's kids.... who need lotion on their hands.... find the.... bottle, wipe an ass, need...a snack. (... play fishing game, more snacks.... oh look, and it's my baby nephew, sure great... family, and shit....)

I want my kids to hate me. I want them to go away. I want them to find reasons to stay away from me. But I literally don't know HOW!! I'm not kidding. How the fuck can I be a bitch? How do I ignore them when they are hungry? How do I ignore them when they are hurt? How do I ignore their emotions or even shame them? I don't know how to do these things, I literally cannot figure out how to be abusive. How can I even call them stupid when I can clearly see they are children and are simply in the process of learning what I already know? I had to stop another mom from calling her kid stupid because we let her drive the little car and she ran over a bunch of stuff and slammed into the wall. How can she be stupid just because she ""didn't stop even though you were yelling stop"" when no one told her HOW to stop? Little girl just turned 5, she doesn't know just take your foot off the peddle! No one said that. She's not stupid, don't say that in my house. And now little girl begs for me to be her babysitter and I'm like... fucking no, I want my kids to avoid me and now another one wants to latch on to me. I already spend all day trying to avoid my children every chance I'm able to.

I can't wait until my kids are teenagers. I hope they hate my guts and I don't see them for weeks. Finally some fucking peace. That's all I want. Just some peace and quiet for things I actually want to do with my life. Just get... the fuck...

Everything revolves around me and I&amp;#39;ve spent my life doing everything I can to make everything NOT revolve even near me. I was constantly called clingy and needy because I wanted to talk with my partners every day, so I shut myself further and further into this state of making myself not needed or wanted. And now I can&amp;#39;t even have a second of peace to sit here writing this post on the potty because there&amp;#39;s 2 screaming children banging on the door. I just want them to go away. Not die, just go away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 6, I hoped my mother would die. I am still waiting for that walking corpse to finally get in the ground and there&amp;#39;s a good chance I&amp;#39;ll never know about it. I remember screaming &amp;quot;I hate you stupid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I hope you die&amp;quot; at her at my daughter&amp;#39;s age. I very shortly knew a woman a few years ago with a very sweet 3yo son, and she threw away something her son loved and he screamed &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re such an idiot mom&amp;quot; and she slapped him yelling &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t you call me an idiot, you idiot.&amp;quot; Exactly how I was raised. My kids? &amp;quot;I love you more than rainbows.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the best mom, mommy.&amp;quot; Me: why must you sit here touching me? &amp;quot;Because I just want to be with you, I love you so much.&amp;quot; My daughter asked me to read from a book of questions and one of them was &amp;quot;what always makes you smile&amp;quot; and I figured it would be her toy or her friend and she says &amp;quot;Your kisses make me smile every time, mommy.&amp;quot; When I make them a dinner they both love there is a chorus of &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re the best, you&amp;#39;re the greatest, we love you&amp;quot; the entire fucking meal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shut up, eat your food, and stop loving me so much! I can&amp;#39;t wait until they are teenagers, take their dinner without asking a million questions about it which takes them hours to eat it and now it&amp;#39;s cold so I have to warm it up, and never want to talk to me. All my older parent friends tell me how much it sucks that their teens NEVER want to talk to them, and how I should cherish every moment and I&amp;#39;m like... is there a way I can hurry this process? They hate their room. There&amp;#39;s everything in there. And they have a huge yard with swings, a slide, sand pit, and a race track for their &amp;quot;My First Tesla&amp;quot; (funny grandma was mad we let the kids paint their own room, was told &amp;quot;you wouldn&amp;#39;t let them drive a car!&amp;quot; Grandma, &lt;em&gt;you&amp;#39;re&lt;/em&gt; the one who literally bought them an electric vehicle, of course we let them drive a car and paint!). They don&amp;#39;t want any of it, they want to find me anywhere I hide and complain how it&amp;#39;s not exactly the way they want it and omg I just... I want to hurt them. Omg, you don&amp;#39;t have the bounce house your friend has so your whole day is ruined... fuck you bitch, I didn&amp;#39;t have ANY of what you have! I ate out of trash cans, was called stupid, worthless and unlovable daily, and I didn&amp;#39;t even have a DADDY! Or a fucking sibling! I had nothing, no family, nothing but a bitch mother that moved us every year so I had no friends. Been around the world and I hated every second. Even through the pandemic my daughter has used my phone to video chat her friends more than I&amp;#39;ve used my phone for anything else! I&amp;#39;m doing everything I can to keep my children&amp;#39;s lives stable as we try to find our way as adults. And all my kids can do is complain. They have more blood family on their dad&amp;#39;s side than people I have called &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; in my entire life. And still &amp;quot;I wish I had...&amp;quot; I wish you&amp;#39;d shut your fucking mouth and just be thankful! Every fucking present under that Christmas tree was for my kids this year, 30+ of them, from the whole family,  they were all wrapped with bows, some with &amp;quot;from Santa&amp;quot; and even though we had covid and were isolating, family AND friends showed up and stood at the street while we opened gifts on the porch. When I was a kid, I got a gift (often panties) wrapped in a shopping bag and was imprisoned in my house for the day because &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s a family holiday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have given anything to be alone in my room as a kid. Just get me away from my mother! But no, she never let me close my door, she hunted me down, forced me to go out with her. She told me she hopes my kids turn out like I was. Hahahahahaha, bitch please! I hope my kids turn out like me too! If they want nothing to do with me in the same fashion as I wanted nothing to do with her, I&amp;#39;d be overjoyed! I&amp;#39;d finally have the chance to go outside and take a fucking WALK! But no, I can&amp;#39;t go for a walk because then I feel guilty so I spend 45 min getting the kids ready for a 10 min walk around the block that is stressful as fuck. So I don&amp;#39;t go out. Today is gorgeous, I&amp;#39;ll spend it inside because they are stressful to take anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully admit I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared for this. I was expecting them to be like I was, hide away in their room to play together. I would have given anything for a sibling! And all they do is fight! Wtf? I&amp;#39;ve been told this is normal for siblings, but why? If you piss off your sibling who will play with you? And why always me!? Why can&amp;#39;t I have a week to myself? I haven&amp;#39;t had more than a couple of hours without my kids since they were born. I have dreams, I have things I want to do, I used to be an artist. Now every one of my art books is destroyed with scribbles and not one pencil is safe, even on the highest shelf! I can&amp;#39;t write, can&amp;#39;t read, can&amp;#39;t draw, can&amp;#39;t play video games because it&amp;#39;s constant &amp;quot;mommy mommy mommy mommy mommy&amp;quot; screaming through the house. And yes, hubby helps, but only so far as to let me shower, nap or get chores done, but not for the rest of life. How come I can find plenty of family to watch them for an 8 hour rat race job but I can&amp;#39;t find a moment of peace for something I actually want to do that could make me just as much if I had any one who had some faith in it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how long it&amp;#39;s taken me to write this? Over 4 (now 5) hours now. A couple.... of words at a.... time because I turn ar... ound and there&amp;#39;s kids.... who need lotion on their hands.... find the.... bottle, wipe an ass, need...a snack. (... play fishing game, more snacks.... oh look, and it&amp;#39;s my baby nephew, sure great... family, and shit....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my kids to hate me. I want them to go away. I want them to find reasons to stay away from me. But I literally don&amp;#39;t know HOW!! I&amp;#39;m not kidding. How the fuck can I be a bitch? How do I ignore them when they are hungry? How do I ignore them when they are hurt? How do I ignore their emotions or even shame them? I don&amp;#39;t know how to do these things, I literally cannot figure out how to be abusive. How can I even call them stupid when I can clearly see they are children and are simply in the process of learning what I already know? I had to stop another mom from calling her kid stupid because we let her drive the little car and she ran over a bunch of stuff and slammed into the wall. How can she be stupid just because she &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t stop even though you were yelling stop&amp;quot; when no one told her HOW to stop? Little girl just turned 5, she doesn&amp;#39;t know just take your foot off the peddle! No one said that. She&amp;#39;s not stupid, don&amp;#39;t say that in my house. And now little girl begs for me to be her babysitter and I&amp;#39;m like... fucking no, I want my kids to avoid me and now another one wants to latch on to me. I already spend all day trying to avoid my children every chance I&amp;#39;m able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait until my kids are teenagers. I hope they hate my guts and I don&amp;#39;t see them for weeks. Finally some fucking peace. That&amp;#39;s all I want. Just some peace and quiet for things I actually want to do with my life. Just get... the fuck... OFF!&lt;/p&gt;

I live in the Philippines and the pandemic messed up the tourism here, and that affected us a lot. We just lost our customers. And as a result, we are forced to stay in my uncle's office. 

We stay in thankfully, inside a village. But we are surrounded with the what we call ""squatters"", who are people living not in the village, but in an area where tons of people live together in close space. It's hard to explain. They aren't exactly squatters, but we call them that since they behave like one.

There is one household who has like three Jeepneys, and a sari-sari store (Basically a small shop selling stuff) and I hate them.

At night, 6-7 people would gather around 11:00 PM and start their conversation for the whole night. They talked until 6:00AM straight with no rest. They speak so loud that I can hear them with earplugs, windows closed, and turned on aircon. Their laugh is annoying as well. Really high-pitched despite a man laughing. They literally laugh like monkeys. I am forced to hear whatever they are saying, and stay up the whole night. I have online classes come on!

It is only them who are talking at night. Also, I can see that they have bluetooth speaker so I can hear the Facebook messenger notification sound.

And at day, they might turn on the jeepneys and all the gas comes to our house, forcing to close our windows and give up indoor ventilation.

Sometimes they would burn trash and all the fumes come to us. It smells like burning plastic. 

I absolutely cannot forgive those who take someone else's sleep. Why must I stay up because of them? I also cannot stand the harmful fumes they give. I just want to sleep properly! I recorded some of their ridiculous conversations and I actually want to upload them to youtube. 

I cannot report them as I am a foreigner, and I am not fluent with their language, and also I'm just a high school student. This isn't our house as well.

Before I moved in, I had an Indian neighbor who was loud, but they were silent at night. I miss them now.

I'm only staying here for a short time, but it's so frustrating. The pandemic, those jeepney house, financial problem, my online classes... If it wasn't for the pandemic, I would have at least have sleep every night.

,rant,"TW for possible sexual coercion, mental illness, friendship issues and just general sadness

Hellooooooo. 

Something happened that really badly affected me. I think about it everyday with such heavy sadness. The thing is, I’m not sure if I’m justified in feeling this way. Some people can be pretty invalidating about it and treat my reaction as an overreaction. I want to talk about it here because it’s nice to get it off my chest, and if I am in the wrong I want to be put in my place. This may be long.

This story involves a best friend and an ex-boyfriend. I have known best friend for more than 10 years and been very close with her the whole time. She knew all my deepest secrets, her house was my safe space, we’d spend every day together blah blah blah. There were quite a few things she did that made me feel like dirt, inferior. But I didn’t properly realise until after this incident. 

This ex-boyfriend was mean. He forgot my birthday; never did anything for my birthday, Christmas, valentines etc when I organised something and gave him things each time (thought that counts), he never asked to see me- we would see each other maybe once a fortnight and if I asked for more he’d call me needy, he hooked up with another girl 2 days after our first kiss together and only stopped because his friends made him. His friends told me he was even saying, “c’mon, 5 more minutes” to them. He would brag about how rich he is but the only cent he ever spent on me was $7 for a drink I didn’t ask him to get me which he made me pay him back for. Knowing that I’ve suffered an eating disorder, the first time he saw me naked he said, “you should go to the gym more” while poking my stomach. We had a pregnancy scare and he up and left for several days leaving me to deal with it alone. I ran into him with his friends and he hugged me when I was visibly upset about all of this then said to his friends, “look guys, I can still make her horny”. He had a car yet made me ride my bike for 2 hours to get to his instead of driving 20 minutes to see him. He made it feel like such an inconvenience whenever he picked me up :(. He would call me pathetic for not having my licence yet (I had spent the past several years in and out of hospital for the eating disorder). He bailed on a dinner my family made specifically for him to hang out with a “friend” who was upset (that friend is now his girlfriend, he told me she was upset about her boyfriend breaking up with her but I ended up finding out that didn’t happen till weeks after the dinner). I got alcohol poisoning at a party with his friends and he kept telling me how disgusting it was seeing my naked body and me throwing up then acted like a champion to his friends for just driving me home then telling my parents to take care of me: When the whole night had been me sitting in my vomit, barely conscious while he laughed through the window and his friends poured cleaning product on my phone and broke it. He would ignore most of my messages and send flirty messages to every girl in his contacts. This stuff made me feel absolutely worthless- like people were doing me a favour by being around me. The worst of it was different. The worst of it caused trauma that I’m still dealing with. All he cared about was sex. This went too far in 2 situations: I overdosed and asked him to pick me up from the hospital when they said I could go home. He said he couldn’t and he didn’t want to talk because this was too much for him (he made me promise from then not to talk about my feelings or issues because it was too stressful for him to listen to). He called a bit later and said he changed his mind. I realised there was a bit of a condition to it though when we got home and he started having sex with me. I was there after a failed suicide attempt, still shaking from the effect of the pills, crying silent tears as he used me without even looking at me. The other one: I was raped. I was out drinking and my best friend (here she is again) who I usually share an uber with left to hook up with her ex, calling it a family emergency. My phone was out of charge and I had no cash so I ended up going home with a random bartender who said he could give me a lift but took me to his house and trapped me there for almost 24 hours… I asked ex boyfriend to pick me up and explained what happened when I was in the bathroom and had a chance to escape. He said he was too busy with math homework. Long story slightly shorter- a friend got me out of there and drove me to ex boyfriends house. I wanted to see him because I was so broken and distressed and wanted comfort from the person who was meant to love me. We were talking on the couch and I showed him the blood on my undies from the force of the rape. He said, “well we can’t go in that way, how about you give me a blow job?”…

Needless to say, I was terrified of him. He ended up breaking up with me because he said I’m not lovable and not that likeable and he wanted to go find “the one”. Found out he called me crazy to a bunch of people (yes, I have mental illnesses, but really? :().

Best friend had a party later and invited ex boyfriend. I figured it was a mistake. The only connection she had to him was from hearing me cry about all the things above. Different schools, jobs, friends etc. She informed that no, they were friends now and if I had a problem with it I shouldn’t come. I told her it upset me, she said she has the right to hang out with whoever she wants to, which is true but wasn't really the point. One of the only good things I got out of ex boyfriend was his friend group. But now all I see is best friend and friend group on each others social medias while I can't see them anymore because they're always with ex boyfriend.

Her party last year involved her barely acknowledging me and her sitting on his lap drunk. I had a lot of panic attacks. It felt like a nightmare. Her party this year involved her, ex boyfriend, ex boyfriends whole friend group and ex boyfriends new girlfriend. A lot of her old friends cut her off. I had a massive breakdown and not long after another suicide attempt. 

My safe space got ripped from me and my best friend befriended my abuser. It has been so painful. I feel so alone because no one acknowledges how bad this feels… unless it isn’t? Please help. What do you think? Do I have a right to be upset?

&lt;p&gt;Hellooooooo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something happened that really badly affected me. I think about it everyday with such heavy sadness. The thing is, I’m not sure if I’m justified in feeling this way. Some people can be pretty invalidating about it and treat my reaction as an overreaction. I want to talk about it here because it’s nice to get it off my chest, and if I am in the wrong I want to be put in my place. This may be long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story involves a best friend and an ex-boyfriend. I have known best friend for more than 10 years and been very close with her the whole time. She knew all my deepest secrets, her house was my safe space, we’d spend every day together blah blah blah. There were quite a few things she did that made me feel like dirt, inferior. But I didn’t properly realise until after this incident. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ex-boyfriend was mean. He forgot my birthday; never did anything for my birthday, Christmas, valentines etc when I organised something and gave him things each time (thought that counts), he never asked to see me- we would see each other maybe once a fortnight and if I asked for more he’d call me needy, he hooked up with another girl 2 days after our first kiss together and only stopped because his friends made him. His friends told me he was even saying, “c’mon, 5 more minutes” to them. He would brag about how rich he is but the only cent he ever spent on me was $7 for a drink I didn’t ask him to get me which he made me pay him back for. Knowing that I’ve suffered an eating disorder, the first time he saw me naked he said, “you should go to the gym more” while poking my stomach. We had a pregnancy scare and he up and left for several days leaving me to deal with it alone. I ran into him with his friends and he hugged me when I was visibly upset about all of this then said to his friends, “look guys, I can still make her horny”. He had a car yet made me ride my bike for 2 hours to get to his instead of driving 20 minutes to see him. He made it feel like such an inconvenience whenever he picked me up :(. He would call me pathetic for not having my licence yet (I had spent the past several years in and out of hospital for the eating disorder). He bailed on a dinner my family made specifically for him to hang out with a “friend” who was upset (that friend is now his girlfriend, he told me she was upset about her boyfriend breaking up with her but I ended up finding out that didn’t happen till weeks after the dinner). I got alcohol poisoning at a party with his friends and he kept telling me how disgusting it was seeing my naked body and me throwing up then acted like a champion to his friends for just driving me home then telling my parents to take care of me: When the whole night had been me sitting in my vomit, barely conscious while he laughed through the window and his friends poured cleaning product on my phone and broke it. He would ignore most of my messages and send flirty messages to every girl in his contacts. This stuff made me feel absolutely worthless- like people were doing me a favour by being around me. The worst of it was different. The worst of it caused trauma that I’m still dealing with. All he cared about was sex. This went too far in 2 situations: I overdosed and asked him to pick me up from the hospital when they said I could go home. He said he couldn’t and he didn’t want to talk because this was too much for him (he made me promise from then not to talk about my feelings or issues because it was too stressful for him to listen to). He called a bit later and said he changed his mind. I realised there was a bit of a condition to it though when we got home and he started having sex with me. I was there after a failed suicide attempt, still shaking from the effect of the pills, crying silent tears as he used me without even looking at me. The other one: I was raped. I was out drinking and my best friend (here she is again) who I usually share an uber with left to hook up with her ex, calling it a family emergency. My phone was out of charge and I had no cash so I ended up going home with a random bartender who said he could give me a lift but took me to his house and trapped me there for almost 24 hours… I asked ex boyfriend to pick me up and explained what happened when I was in the bathroom and had a chance to escape. He said he was too busy with math homework. Long story slightly shorter- a friend got me out of there and drove me to ex boyfriends house. I wanted to see him because I was so broken and distressed and wanted comfort from the person who was meant to love me. We were talking on the couch and I showed him the blood on my undies from the force of the rape. He said, “well we can’t go in that way, how about you give me a blow job?”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I was terrified of him. He ended up breaking up with me because he said I’m not lovable and not that likeable and he wanted to go find “the one”. Found out he called me crazy to a bunch of people (yes, I have mental illnesses, but really? :().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best friend had a party later and invited ex boyfriend. I figured it was a mistake. The only connection she had to him was from hearing me cry about all the things above. Different schools, jobs, friends etc. She informed that no, they were friends now and if I had a problem with it I shouldn’t come. I told her it upset me, she said she has the right to hang out with whoever she wants to, which is true but wasn&amp;#39;t really the point. One of the only good things I got out of ex boyfriend was his friend group. But now all I see is best friend and friend group on each others social medias while I can&amp;#39;t see them anymore because they&amp;#39;re always with ex boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

It reminds me of a time in college where I tried to be there for my girlfriend and my roommate as much as I could and they both thought I was spending too much time with the other. It’s how it seems to be going with all my relationships now and it’s affecting my health.  


I’ve spent my life in my eyes as this loser that everyone knew. But more and more, I realize a lot of people in high school and my life cared more about me than I thought. They wanted to be around me, do stuff with me. Normally when I’m out with people I am very sociable and engaging. But there are times when I can’t do it. I have to just shut myself away and be with me. I enjoy loneliness because I’ve spent more time alone than I have with people and it just comforts me. It’s the one thing no one I know seems to just get. They always want me with them. I enjoy it too and it’s no fault on them, it’s just exhausting when I don’t ever have a day to myself.  


I got new roommates in October and they’ve taken to me really well. They always want me to do stuff with them and just be around. They’re really cool and I like them, but there are those times where I don’t want to spend with them and they give me these subtle jabs that make me feel like shit for not spending time together. My friends that I play with online for years started doing the same. Despite that, I tried to balance being with both of them.  


My friend of almost a decade just removed me as a friend from steam, and it sounds stupid, but it hurt. It could all be solved with just a talk, but I don’t know where to even start. I’m starting a new life together with an amazing woman and now there’s another person I want to dedicate my time to and that has me neglecting even more friends.  


I got covid and still tried my best to just be there for my friends online, my girlfriend and my roommates. That was months ago, but I still experience the occasional terrible bouts of chest pain that make me want to go to the hospital. The only reason I don’t ever go or check it out is because I can’t afford it.  


The only thing that helps is weed. Makes me forget the pain. Makes me forget that I’m me for a while too. I feel torn because I want to be there for everyone, but at the cost of my own health I’m losing friends and I’m at the point where I can juggle it anymore. Even now it feels like my heart is in a vice and I’m seconds away from a heart attack. I’ve been feeling this way for fucking months and I can’t do it anymore.  


My only saving grace now is my girlfriend who I just met a few months ago. Despite all my problems emotionally, she is being there for me. I need to focus on getting my body covid free and just being there for us. If I keep trying to juggle my relationships I’m going to worry myself to death or end up doing it myself.  


I’m just tired. I wish so badly I was the loser I always thought I was. I love all my friends, but I can’t emotionally handle any of this anymore. I’m not strong enough and I don’t think I ever will be. I wish my friends didn’t hold me to this high standard. What makes this hard is that I love them all so dearly, but I can’t always be there. It’s this pain I feel of not being good enough despite knowing that it isn’t the case, yet I still feel that way. This constant tug in my heart of wondering what these amazing people see in me.  


Losing them is just as hard as struggling to be there for them. I don’t know what else I can do. Writing this seemed to help, but I miss not having covid.

Then from then on, a few of my other friends found out as well, but I wasn't the one who told them and I never gave permission to anyone to tell others. So then of course they told other friends (so my former high school classmates know about it). 

So recently, I have moved back home. My mom comes home one day and tells me that she met my classmate X from high school and she asked how I am, what am I up to etc. My mom told her I'm fine, going to school etc. Then she asks 'is she living with a girlfriend?' (she was obviously told by one of our former classmates  that I'm gay) My mom recounted this to me with sort of a confused look on her face, since she doesn't know I'm gay, she thought she was asking 'Is she living with a girl friend?' NOT A GIRLFRIEND. And my mom told her no, she is living at home. Why the fuck would you ask that? Who the fuck cares where I live? It's not like she's going to come and visit, I never speak to this person. She was asking because she was being nosy, she wanted to know if I had a girlfriend or not.


So basically a person I never speak to anymore and whom I never told I was gay personally asked my mother whether I had a girlfriend and whether I was living with her. Jesus fucking Christ. 

She has alway been a nosy person and she isn't the only one. There are so many people and old friends where I haven't seen them for a while and if I do see them, they start being nosy like 'are you dating anyone' and people always discuss who's dating who. Why the fuck are people so nosy? Why do people care whether you're fucking someone or not? When I meet someone I haven't seen for a while I NEVER start being nosy about their personal affairs like this, it's none of my business whether random person#43 in my life is dating someone or not, and why would this be one of the first questions I ask someone when I meet them? WTF?  I don't give a fuck whether someone lives with their husband and three kids or in their mom's basement.

anyways i will skip the parts i don't remember, so let me start with how he talk his way out of a mental hospital and nearly had the chance to kill us if not for the fact that one of the nurses didn't believe that he was mentally stable and called us before hand to warn us to move as fast as possible, so we did and just in time i think if i remember correctly we moved in half a day and i for one think that was impassive because we lived on the 3rd or 5th floor, we then moved some 100 KM or 62 miles away from him.

skip forward a bit and we get to the part when we had forced visitation with him, for some fucked reason here in Denmark children have to visit the other parent that they do not live with, he had to have one more person with him with the visits though then comes the fateful day he doesn't have one more person with him, then because my mom wouldn't open the door to let him  take us with him for the visit he tried to kick the door in and threatened to kill my mom called her a whore and a lot more i don't remember, and when he finally left my mom called the police and made a report, (i think that's what its called in English) but he just got of with a warning because the police is hella corrupt, he only got off because he used to be a police man so he just got off from at least property damage attempted breaking an entering. (i don't know about the law for breaking an entering) That is what i remember from when i was 6 to 7 years old now i will skip to like 3 years ago so 2018 when i was 11 when me and my little sister finally stop seeing our ""dad"" because out mom finally said stop because it was takeing a toll on both me and my sisters mental and physical health, but it took maybe a year for my mom to get a judge to see that out ""dad"" was the reason for our mental and physical health not being the best and we finally got away from that bastard my mental health has been a LOT better then it was when we had to see the bastard.

&amp;#x200B;

also there's that time when he took a lot of loans in my moms name, so isn't that also identity fraud on the list of thing he could have been arrested for right? Don't if you can be arrested for that or not, but that's all i remember of things although i will try to answer as many question's as possible.

I was a kid so I was annoying, of course. Thing is, my mother’s reaction to it seemed unnecessary. To constantly remind a 4-5 year old how much of an annoyance he is and that that’s why his classmates don’t enjoy his company. 

Then a couple years later when traveling with another family to Disneyland, she wouldn’t even let me play with them because I’d just get on their nerves and they don’t actually like me. 

Then my elementary school graduation, she didn’t want to have a party because no one would come and I wasn’t actually liked all that much. She kept saying more and more stuff like that throughout the years and somehow I’ve managed to bury them. 

Recently though I’ve been discovering more and more messed up shit she’s said to me. During a conversation, she mentioned all the things I can’t do. Hold a conversation, keep a friend, act normal, etc. Even going so far to compare me to my convict younger brother. Saying how she wishes I was more like him. I ignore that of course.

She said that I was forcing them to go to Japan with me, that none of them wanted to go, they only went so that I would shut up about it. 

Just a week ago, she was complaining that I bother my friends and that none of them actually like me, and they just feel bad for me and that’s why they hang out with me.

 Like, check it. I'm this 20 year old guy, a university student in his first year of a bachelor's degree of science and engineering with a major in chemistry. Working part time, living with my dad and paying rent/board. Got a good hourly rate too. Get my chores, and study done, keep my expenses in check, and not that it's an issue but I do sometimes drink too much but lately I've been really good about it. Not for nothing but I'd say I've really got my shit together.

Now there's 4 others who, not by choice, I'm constantly exposed to. I can't exactly categorize them, because they all fit a multitude of descriptions. They're all dropouts, and addicts, and generally cunts. To me specifically for no reason. Disclaimer by the way, I'm not trying to paint some ransoms in a bad light, the people I'm describing are genuinely shitty people. The will remain anonymous however.

One is like, a TikTokker incarnate. I don't know if being an obnoxious hoebag is an off camera thing but she considers that her official personality, and calls it being quirky. As if she's got a huge instagram following or some shit. Another one, the transient, moved in to my dad's place because his home life was shit. And tbh, I think he was just as big a fucking problem as his parents, if not more. The agreement was he do his share of work around here. This fucker has done the dishes a total of 4 times in the span of like, 6-7 months, and not once properly. Not mentioning all the other shit he was meant to do. It's a squanderment to my father's generosity, and he would have been kicked out long ago if there wasn't some kind of contractual obligation with a youth services thing who pay him to look after this kid.

The third, my brother, is the fucking worst. He thinks he can walk around like top shit and say or do anything to anyone, and just get away with it. And most of the time, he actually does get away with it, because the measured and appropriate response would be to fuck him the fuck up, to which he would respond with calling the police which yeah, fair that's assault. But you're out here laughing at someone for trying to fix something, simply because you believe they lack the skills, and you expect not to get punched? This is the kind of shit I have to put up with on the daily. And like, somehow I'm the bully in our relationship. Our daily conversation is usually me saying something like ""Sack the fuck up, you're 17, not 3. People shouldn't have to clean up after you. And I'm sure as shit not gonna.do it unless you pay me."" Then he'll be like ""fuck off you ugly ass fat bitch and kill yourself, no one even wants you around."" And I don't know how he's calling me ugly, this nibba looks, smells, and acts like a DnD goblin who got their head used as a morbidly obese person's TP. But for real, anytime he gets called out on his shit, he throws a tantrum, yells a bunch, starts crying and storms off. And it makes me feel bad for my parents because he was the planned one. This kid is actually almost a legal adult and still doesn't have object permanence.

Okay, those listed above have wronged me, myself not included, at least not in the traditional sense. They even fucked up this couch I own. Cut up and burned the leather and ripped out the stuffing. For no reason too. Goddamn bullshit. But this last one saddens me. Because he used to be my best mate. And he started dating the obnoxious hoebag, then my cunty goblin brother started praising him like he was a fucking god, like 1 step away from sucking his dick. The transient was kind of just there. Now I'm not jealous that he ditched me, it's happened before. I'm simply angry. We were mates for 8 years, and he just threw that away because ""I'm a bully"".

 You may recall me presenting an example conversation earlier in the rant where I told my brother to sack the fuck up and clean up after himself. That wasn't a joke. That was a fight I've had with him for almost 900 consecutive days. first time, ask politely, times two and three, lead by example. By time 900 you're having a full nuclear meltdown. And you might say it's not my problem, but when I can't find a fork anywhere in the house, or the rubbish bins overflowing or there's a stack of laundry more massive than I am, then it's my goddamn problem. And if so, why don't I just sack up and do it myself? I have, multiple times. I shouldn't have to every single week. But idk. I was angry. And apparently I'm the only person in the whole world who isn't allowed to be angry, especially over a reasonable thing. These guys can throw tantrums because they lost their phone or they have no weed or my sweet dog is there or some other 4th thing (The transient really don't do much, he kinda just never cleans the house and never takes a shower and gets high and fucks around all day, but that's it), but the minute I get fucked off about a reasonable issue, I'm the anger issues bully. And as for the former friend, I've considered talking shit out with him, and not apologizing because I didn't actually do anything wrong but figuring out what went wrong bc we were tight as fuck, and It all went to shit in like, 10 minutes. Like, I have a theory, but I'm not entirely sound with it.

So long rant short, I'm the lowest status character of my household and beyond because, besides my dad, I'm the only one who has my shit together. I've probably painted myself in a better light than I deserve so let me close by affirming that I'm not good, I'm not bad, I'm just decent and honest. And what these people perceive as being a fucking asshole, probably to a degree. But every word of what I say to them is the objective truth.

A lot of SAHMs are only SAHMs for a short while and then get back into the working scene as the child gets older. A lot of SAHMs are only SAHMs because childcare is crazy expensive. I get that. But that job has a shelf life. Your kids will get older and need less and less from you. Then they move out and that's it for your career as a stay at home parent. Unless you have a never ending convenience line of babies, and that's a whole rant in and of itself. 

When I have asked anyone whose entire life goal was to be a stay at home mom why they don't foster they always say the same thing, ""Oh, no, I want my own, I couldn't really love someone I didn't give birth."" 

First of all, that means you can't love your husband, parents, friends, or anyone else in your life. Second of all, I'm judging you. Third of all, you all damn well know the real reason you don't want to foster for the rest of your life because it's actual work. 

I ask any of these women, what about when they're at school or what about when they grow up and move out? Sure enough every single one of these women I've asked also always have the same answer like they're reading a dang script or something. ""Oh, well, I'm going to cook, clean, and do the shopping."" Okay, then you can also do instacart or work at a restaurant part time while the kid's at school because it doesn't take all damn week to keep the house in mediocre order. Most of these women just want to have their own so they can spend the majority of their time and life doing fork-all. 

If you really want to be a stay at home parent and that's your life goal then BECOME A FOSTER PARENT! It is a huge understaffed and highly necessary job. There is a never ending line of unwanted and abused children that need a good mom. You can spend the rest of your life with an incredibly fulfilling career as a stay at home parent and actually get paid to do it. So why don't you people want to do it?

Adding in because I know people will ask. I am a woman, no I'm not a foster parent. I'm not a biological parent either. I don't want kids. It's fine if you don't want kids and it's fine if you want your own kids. I'm aiming this rant specifically at those women we all know who have never made in effort to get a career or in any way support themselves because their entire goal in life is just to get married and be a ""SAHM"", but really because they're lazy and still want to claim that they built a legacy.

i really don’t know what else to do with this, it’s actually driving me mad and it just makes me angry. please don’t read this if the TW upsets you. 

so i was in a relationship with my boyfriend for well over a year (both 16, we got back together now but that’s a whole different story). in that time he did assault me a few times (nothing bad or horribly violent, pretty much nothing in comparison to what some people have been put through). 

after we broke up, i went a bit “mad” mainly because of the pent up rage, guilt, embarrassment and disgust at him and myself for the assaults happening. i told a few of my friends, not with the intent of “getting back at him” or “tarnishing his name” (we had a lot of mutuals so it might’ve spread idk) and my parents after i had a complete breakdown at school 

my mother knew before my father did though. they both had the exact same reaction “there’s nothing we can do about it. get over it.” 

i’ll admit i was pretty crushed, so in a fit of anger i confessed the ‘gory’ details of exactly what happened. still: no real emotion from either of them. oh no my father did storm out angrily when i refused to say in front of him what exactly happened. 

in fact they blamed me for drinking, letting him do that, not fighting him off. it really hurt me. 

my friends kept on telling me to tell them so i could get some real support and maybe my parents would do something. (they did tell me to go to the police but i outright refused for a number of reasons). my friends told me that if it were them and their parents found out they would’ve been absolutely distraught and furious. 

i guess it kinda points to me wanting sort of validation for what happened. but they did not and have not said anything to me about it. when i do try and talk about it i’m shut down, so i gave up. 

i’m getting some sort of support from school (bit difficult cos the big C-bug). and i am kind of “over it” now 

my bf reached out and sent me a serious formal apology, and it got us talking again. he’s changed and i forgave him, and i’m completely happy with my decision because i still do love him and i’m not the type of person to hold onto hate. i know people might find that strange but it’s okay. my best mate supports me in this as well (godbless her she’s my rock!)

i did wonder if anyone else had experienced this with parents/carers. because they’re like this with pretty much everything; extremely dismissive and emotionless

I was prescribed birth control at age 12 due to walking about 10 ft from the bathroom to my bedroom across the hall and sitting down and being soaked through the largest size tampon and pad. I once had a clot the size of a golf ball (if they could get flat). My mom was considering getting me adult diapers. I was starting to faint from low iron due to so much blood being lost.

Due to various reasons, I’ve since stopped taking the pill and haven’t in years, and it’s been fine, I don’t bleed anymore but like once a year. BUT when I DO bleed that one time a year or so, it’s BAD like it was all those years ago. This is what happened these past few days.

I have about 2 pairs of pants left currently (one being work pants), and I started this with a box of regular, super, and super plus tampons with barely any taken out.

,rant,"I recently moved to Australia, and as part of my move I got a new Aussie phone number. Someone gave me a gift card for Deliveroo as a way to say ""Welcome to the country, mate"", and so I downloaded the app and signed up. 

Well, I *tried* to sign up at least. See, my new number doesn't pass their validation checks for being a real phone number. It just throws the error saying ""Couldn't validate your phone number"". Alright, well tech happens. So I reach out to Deliveroo customer support and after 30 minutes on hold the guy on the phone tells me that he's going to need to escalate my ticket. Cool. I send him screenshots of the error and await a response. 

A few hours later, a Deliveroo customer service representative (I think that title is sarcastic, given my experience) emails me back and tells me to enter ""a correct phone number and proper country code"". I'm pretty sure this is a Brit English/American miscommunication, but it just seems a bit condescending to tell someone to enter a ""proper"" phone number. *You peasant, enter a real number*. When I respond that I entered my correct phone number, crickets. No response for the rest of the day. Well, let's try something else. I go on Twitter and message @DeliverooHelp (which again, must be a parody account) who again asks me to send screenshots of my error. After I do, they too go silent. I called the same customer service line back again and they tell me that they can't do anything to help me because they can only deal with order disputes, not account creation. It's best if I just wait for a response from the comedians known as Deliveroo customer service representatives. 

Friday goes by, and no one contacts me. I call *again* hoping to get patched through or get an email address of someone who can actually address my problem, but no. The Deliveroo technical team is apparently an endangered species who can't be bothered to have contact with the outside world, and the best they can do is open another ticket for me. The representative on the phone (who is nice, though not helpful) tells me that the best thing to do is continue to wait. 

This afternoon, I get another email from their customer support team. This time, a *different* CSR tells me ""If you're having difficulty with your details, make sure that your name, email address and phone number fields are all filled in."" I responded to him that this is not the problem I am having, and now I get the joy of waiting another 48 hours to get a response. And I'm sure it will be another canned response telling me to make sure that I'm writing in English or to try when Mercury isn't in retrograde or something equally as useless. 

I'm baffled by this. How is everyone at Deliveroo this inept? Is this on purpose? Do they get paid according to how many pointless messages they send? Are they actually two children in a trench coat?

During my past trip to Florida and nearly every summer break or winter and whatever school break I sleep super late and shit but recovered and slept again just fine.

During this year when Covid-19 took the world by storm and gave rise to online classes, even when I stayed up until my first mandatory Zoom meeting I recovered and slept again just fine. Even had occasional naps and managed to sleep at night.

For the vast majority of them, it's never an original thought but rather bits and pieces of untruths regurgitated and coughed up like an idiot version of Chinese Whispers.

This is about how it goes, and I'm paraphrasing all from a multitude of conversations I've had in the past. Please don't accuse me of creating a strawman here, because these exact beliefs are held by a huge amount of people, and I will be happy to link such people if asked.

&gt;These ""transgenders"" are folks that are *so mentally ill* that they are convinced that they are gender that they are not. But society is so PC nowadays that we aren't allowed to treat them like we should so the problem is spiraling out of control. **People humor their delusions, and feed into them.** Even doctors will perform **surgical mutilations** on these people in order to feed their crazy antics. A delusional man thinks he's a woman and walks into a surgical clinic to get a vagina, instead they give him an **open wound** that the transgender needs to **dilate** in order to stop it from closing up again. Disgusting. So it's no wonder that they're so unhinged that they have a **41% suicide rate.** No matter what drugs they can get doctors to pump into them, no matter what surgeries they get \[At this point, they usually cite the 2008 Swedish study of trans people by Cecilia Dhejne\], **no matter how many people humor them, they end up being suicidal anyways.** This needs to end. The best way to help them is not to humor them, not to coddle them, but to do what we do to any other delusional people. They need therapy, involuntary commitment if necessary, to get them to accept their bodies as they truly are and ditch the charades. We can't keep doing this, we can't keep feeding their delusions.

Basically, people who are prejudiced against trans people have absolutely no desire to respectful of our gender identity, and instead treat us as delusional and try to enforce onto us our birth gender out of spite. But the sad thing is, *few people will want to admit to themselves that they're being cruel, everyone wants to be the righteous protagonist in every situation.* Instead, the above narrative is **manufactured** in order to convince transphobic people that they are doing the right thing in their behavior. It's all the *supportive* people that are wrong! They want trans people to ""get better"" and ""accept themselves for who they are"", so they ""don't humor their delusions"".

In the ideal world of the above person, transgender people would not receive hormone replacement therapy, would not receive any surgeries, and our gender identities would never be socially accepted. Instead, we would be send to a conversion therapist to try and get us to live as our assigned gender at any cost.

**The cruel, cruel irony of this is that the professional consensus on the issue says the exact opposite. The kind of treatment these people give us, and the culture that surrounds them, is a huge part of the problem. That's the horrible thing. They weaponize suicide statistics to paint us as unhinged and deluded in order to advocate for practices that actually** ***lead*** **us towards suicidality.**

So in this post, I want to unpack everything that they said in the above narrative and explain why it's measurably ***wrong.***

&gt;These ""transgenders"" are folks that are *so mentally ill* that they are convinced that they are gender that they are not.

Not true, this is just conflating biological sex and gender identity. Transgender people have a gender identity that conflicts with the biological sex they were born as (or assigned in the case of intersex people). We are *very* aware of biological sex, which is why the significant majority of (binary) trans people end up going through some sort of medical transition to change our phenotypic sexual characteristics to whatever extent is medically possible.

Hormone replacement therapy being the most common, since it changes a *vast* amount of your body's  biological sex markers. Trans women can grow breasts, trans men can grow their clitorises into micropenises that can be further extended into fully grown penises surgically w/ the same techniques used for intersex people who are born with micropenises naturally. Trans men grow beards too, while trans women usually experience their body hair thinning out. The difference in male vs. female fat and muscular appearance around the body also makes a huge difference in our appearances, and with HRT this process takes about 3 years to completely change. Body odor is sexually dimorphic and hormone replacement therapy changes it. Orgasms and arousal patterns are also sexually dimorphic and HRT can change this too even before you've had any genital surgery. If you're fortunate enough to be put on puberty blockers before your first round of puberty, even your bone structure will change.

And while that's a controversial issue I'd rather not get into in this post, there are also surgeries and procedures to *reverse* pubescent characteristics in the trans people that weren't so fortunate. For example I've gone through electrolysis hair removal to completely remove my facial hair, and I plan on eventually getting facial feminization surgery to reverse the effect of testosterone on my facial bones. A trans man might get top surgery to reverse pubescent breast growth as well. None of these things would have been necessary for someone who was put on puberty blockers beforehand, but nevertheless I am still very happy and fortunate to live in a first world country where these resources are available albeit difficult to access.

My point is, **trans people are aware of their biological sex.** When a trans woman who has gone through this process goes to a hospital, if the staff is competent she will receive ""MTF"" as her sex on the medical bracelet instead of ""M"" or ""F"", to denote someone who is hormonally female while chromosomally male. Vice versa for trans men getting ""FTM"". A trans woman is a woman in regards to gender but a male, eventually turning into a ""Male-to-female"", in regards to biological sex.

There is no active delusion at play here, which is why that psychologists and therapists don't regard us as delusional. Instead, they help us navigate through the process of transitioning and help us stay sane and centered as we go alone the difficult journey. I would know, I see one every month.

Which brings us to the next bit of misinformation:

&gt;The best way to help them is not to humor them, not to coddle them, but to do what we do to any other delusional people. They need therapy, involuntary commitment if necessary, to get them to accept their bodies as they truly are and ditch the charades. We can't keep doing this, we can't keep feeding their delusions.

This is a particularly annoying narrative because it completely ignores **history.** They say that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, well sadly these folks seem hell-bent on doing so. **There's actually a long history of using conversion therapy, including electroshock therapy, on people with gender dysphoria. It doesn't work, much like conversion therapy for gay people it makes the patient way worse off, which is why professional organizations no longer advocate for these practices.**

**American Medical Association statement against** ***both*** **gay and trans conversion therapy:**

* [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49344152](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49344152)

It's 2021, not 1964. We should know better than to torture people with outdated methods that don't work.

But these folks will also try to convince you that *transitioning* and *social acceptance* don't work either, which brings us to our next bit of misinformation:

&gt;So it's no wonder that they're so unhinged that they have a **41% suicide rate.** No matter what drugs they can get doctors to pump into them, no matter what surgeries they get \[At this point, they usually cite the 2008 Swedish study of trans people by Cecilia Dhejne\], **no matter how many people humor them, they end up being suicidal anyways.**

Before anything, I want to point out that this statistic is very often cited incorrectly *especially as a cruel meme* on edgy reddit and 4chan spaces. The number ""41%"" refers to **lifetime suicidal attempt rate**, not **the amount of trans people the actually kill themselves.** Basically, *still living* transgender people were surveyed and asked ""Have you attempted suicide before"" and 41% answered ""yes"". However most suicide attempts in this manner are cries for help by desperate people, and many occur **before** transitioning especially while living with unsupportive parents as a transgender youth. **I myself am a part of this 41% but am no longer suicidal.**

Onto the next claim, that transitioning doesn't make our mental health better. So there's this single study that is constantly cited, and it's [This one by Cecilia Dhejne](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885). It uses data from **1973-2003,** which ultimately showed that the transgender people had massive problems of poor mental health and suicidality that did not necessarily improve with surgery.

There's a bunch of problems with using this single study to make this argument, but before I list them off I also want to point out that the according to her /r/science *AmA,* [**the author of the study, Cecilia Dhejne, is still a massive advocate for affirmative care for trans people including societal support and access to medical transition.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/)

But here's why it's erroneous to use this study in a vacuum to make the claim that transitioning doesn't actually help.

* Surgical methods have improved massively since the time-period the study was conducted during, the newest ""peritoneum graft method"" of vaginoplatsy for example gives much more realistic results for MTF transitions versus any method that would have been available during 1973-2003
* Societal acceptance has also increased massively since that time period, and transgender people are much more likely to have a support net of family and/or friends. It's basic evolutionary biology that we as human beings are meant to exist within cohesive social groups. Ostracizing someone from society and family will *obviously* make them have poor mental health.
* The people in this study, for the most part, would have transitioned after puberty and would not have had access to vocal training techniques or procedures like facial feminization surgery, which can often times be crucial to helping a post-pubescent transitioned trans woman live seamlessly as a woman in society. Imagine having a surgically crafted vagina but still having a masculine face or deep voice that people constantly treat you like a freak over.

Furthermore, **many newer studies** ***have*** **demonstrated that social and medical transition is beneficial to transgender people!**

   * This **2012** survey shows that **strong parental support of trans youth** reduces the suicide attempt rate to **4%.** Numbers may be even lower now since trans acceptance has progressed even further since 2012.

Finally, let's address the idea that genital reassignment surgery is ""mutilation"".

&gt;Even doctors will perform **surgical mutilations** on these people in order to feed their crazy antics. A delusional man thinks he's a woman and walks into a surgical clinic to get a vagina, instead they give him an **open wound** that the transgender needs to **dilate** in order to stop it from closing up again. Disgusting. So it's no wonder that they're so unhinged that they have a **41% suicide rate.**

This is the kind of language frequently used to paint an image of disgust and medical malpractice in the reader's head.

Similar arguments are made for FTM-related surgeries as well, however for the sake of simplicity I'm going to focus on the MTF-related subject because I am personally more knowledgeable on the subject and additionally these arguments are more common.

More primitive methods of vaginoplatsy exist and are unfortunately still more common, and these may in some cases give less realistic or less desirable results, however I myself am a strong advocate for the newer *peritoneum-graft* method of vaginoplatsy, and hope to get it myself eventually.

I've had the pleasure of even talking to a couple trans women who have had this procedure with positive results, and would suggest reading the above article if you're curious about it.

But essentially, you may have heard people say that the inside of a vagina has tissue that is analogous to the inner cheeks of your mouth. It turns out that another bodily organ has tissue similar to this as well, in a protective lining called the ""peritoneum"" that protects some of your inner organs.

In this method of surgery, the inside of the vagina is crafted using a sample of this tissue.

**Which means it's not actually an ""open wound"" because there is healthy tissue lining the inside of the new vagina.**

Furthermore, the purpose of the Dilation isn't to ""prevent the wound from closing up again"", but rather to

1. In the weeks immediately following the surgery, make sure the new vagina retains its shape as it heals
2. In the time after that, make sure the pelvic muscles are acclimated to the new genitalia such that the vagina doesn't end up too tight

Dilation is a frequent activity but becomes less needed the more time goes on. Eventually, after a year or so, some surgeons argue that it's possible to stop dilation completely so long as you masturbate or have sex at least once a week.

Also, this surgery was originally invented as a **vaginal reconstructive surgery** for intersex women! So it's nonsensical to consider it a form of mutilation, simply ""cutting your dick off"" when the purpose is to *create* genitalia.

Few people might read this entire post, but if I can change at least a few people's minds, that would definitely be better than to let these pieces of misinformation continue to spread unopposed.

So it&amp;#39;s no wonder that they&amp;#39;re so unhinged that they have a &lt;strong&gt;41% suicide rate.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter what drugs they can get doctors to pump into them, no matter what surgeries they get [At this point, they usually cite the 2008 Swedish study of trans people by Cecilia Dhejne], &lt;strong&gt;no matter how many people humor them, they end up being suicidal anyways.&lt;/strong&gt; This needs to end. The best way to help them is not to humor them, not to coddle them, but to do what we do to any other delusional people. They need therapy, involuntary commitment if necessary, to get them to accept their bodies as they truly are and ditch the charades. We can&amp;#39;t keep doing this, we can&amp;#39;t keep feeding their delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, people who are prejudiced against trans people have absolutely no desire to respectful of our gender identity, and instead treat us as delusional and try to enforce onto us our birth gender out of spite. But the sad thing is, &lt;em&gt;few people will want to admit to themselves that they&amp;#39;re being cruel, everyone wants to be the righteous protagonist in every situation.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, the above narrative is &lt;strong&gt;manufactured&lt;/strong&gt; in order to convince transphobic people that they are doing the right thing in their behavior. It&amp;#39;s all the &lt;em&gt;supportive&lt;/em&gt; people that are wrong! They want trans people to &amp;quot;get better&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;accept themselves for who they are&amp;quot;, so they &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t humor their delusions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ideal world of the above person, transgender people would not receive hormone replacement therapy, would not receive any surgeries, and our gender identities would never be socially accepted. Instead, we would be send to a conversion therapist to try and get us to live as our assigned gender at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cruel, cruel irony of this is that the professional consensus on the issue says the exact opposite. The kind of treatment these people give us, and the culture that surrounds them, is a huge part of the problem. That&amp;#39;s the horrible thing. They weaponize suicide statistics to paint us as unhinged and deluded in order to advocate for practices that actually&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;us towards suicidality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this post, I want to unpack everything that they said in the above narrative and explain why it&amp;#39;s measurably &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &amp;quot;transgenders&amp;quot; are folks that are &lt;em&gt;so mentally ill&lt;/em&gt; that they are convinced that they are gender that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not true, this is just conflating biological sex and gender identity. Transgender people have a gender identity that conflicts with the biological sex they were born as (or assigned in the case of intersex people). We are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aware of biological sex, which is why the significant majority of (binary) trans people end up going through some sort of medical transition to change our phenotypic sexual characteristics to whatever extent is medically possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormone replacement therapy being the most common, since it changes a &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; amount of your body&amp;#39;s  biological sex markers. Trans women can grow breasts, trans men can grow their clitorises into micropenises that can be further extended into fully grown penises surgically w/ the same techniques used for intersex people who are born with micropenises naturally. Trans men grow beards too, while trans women usually experience their body hair thinning out. The difference in male vs. female fat and muscular appearance around the body also makes a huge difference in our appearances, and with HRT this process takes about 3 years to completely change. Body odor is sexually dimorphic and hormone replacement therapy changes it. Orgasms and arousal patterns are also sexually dimorphic and HRT can change this too even before you&amp;#39;ve had any genital surgery. If you&amp;#39;re fortunate enough to be put on puberty blockers before your first round of puberty, even your bone structure will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while that&amp;#39;s a controversial issue I&amp;#39;d rather not get into in this post, there are also surgeries and procedures to &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; pubescent characteristics in the trans people that weren&amp;#39;t so fortunate. For example I&amp;#39;ve gone through electrolysis hair removal to completely remove my facial hair, and I plan on eventually getting facial feminization surgery to reverse the effect of testosterone on my facial bones. A trans man might get top surgery to reverse pubescent breast growth as well. None of these things would have been necessary for someone who was put on puberty blockers beforehand, but nevertheless I am still very happy and fortunate to live in a first world country where these resources are available albeit difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is, &lt;strong&gt;trans people are aware of their biological sex.&lt;/strong&gt; When a trans woman who has gone through this process goes to a hospital, if the staff is competent she will receive &amp;quot;MTF&amp;quot; as her sex on the medical bracelet instead of &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;, to denote someone who is hormonally female while chromosomally male. Vice versa for trans men getting &amp;quot;FTM&amp;quot;. A trans woman is a woman in regards to gender but a male, eventually turning into a &amp;quot;Male-to-female&amp;quot;, in regards to biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no active delusion at play here, which is why that psychologists and therapists don&amp;#39;t regard us as delusional. Instead, they help us navigate through the process of transitioning and help us stay sane and centered as we go alone the difficult journey. I would know, I see one every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the next bit of misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

We can&amp;#39;t keep doing this, we can&amp;#39;t keep feeding their delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly annoying narrative because it completely ignores &lt;strong&gt;history.&lt;/strong&gt; They say that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, well sadly these folks seem hell-bent on doing so. &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s actually a long history of using conversion therapy, including electroshock therapy, on people with gender dysphoria. It doesn&amp;#39;t work, much like conversion therapy for gay people it makes the patient way worse off, which is why professional organizations no longer advocate for these practices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Medical Association statement against&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;gay and trans conversion therapy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC story of a trans person who lived through conversion therapy conducted back in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1964&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and lived through many years of trauma as a result:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49344152""&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49344152&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2021, not 1964. We should know better than to torture people with outdated methods that don&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these folks will also try to convince you that &lt;em&gt;transitioning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;social acceptance&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t work either, which brings us to our next bit of misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s no wonder that they&amp;#39;re so unhinged that they have a &lt;strong&gt;41% suicide rate.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter what drugs they can get doctors to pump into them, no matter what surgeries they get [At this point, they usually cite the 2008 Swedish study of trans people by Cecilia Dhejne], &lt;strong&gt;no matter how many people humor them, they end up being suicidal anyways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anything, I want to point out that this statistic is very often cited incorrectly &lt;em&gt;especially as a cruel meme&lt;/em&gt; on edgy reddit and 4chan spaces. The number &amp;quot;41%&amp;quot; refers to &lt;strong&gt;lifetime suicidal attempt rate&lt;/strong&gt;, not &lt;strong&gt;the amount of trans people the actually kill themselves.&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, &lt;em&gt;still living&lt;/em&gt; transgender people were surveyed and asked &amp;quot;Have you attempted suicide before&amp;quot; and 41% answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. However most suicide attempts in this manner are cries for help by desperate people, and many occur &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; transitioning especially while living with unsupportive parents as a transgender youth. &lt;strong&gt;I myself am a part of this 41% but am no longer suicidal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the next claim, that transitioning doesn&amp;#39;t make our mental health better. So there&amp;#39;s this single study that is constantly cited, and it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885""&gt;This one by Cecilia Dhejne&lt;/a&gt;. It uses data from &lt;strong&gt;1973-2003,&lt;/strong&gt; which ultimately showed that the transgender people had massive problems of poor mental health and suicidality that did not necessarily improve with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a bunch of problems with using this single study to make this argument, but before I list them off I also want to point out that the according to her &lt;a href=""/r/science""&gt;/r/science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;AmA,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the author of the study, Cecilia Dhejne, is still a massive advocate for affirmative care for trans people including societal support and access to medical transition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s erroneous to use this study in a vacuum to make the claim that transitioning doesn&amp;#39;t actually help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surgical methods have improved massively since the time-period the study was conducted during, the newest &amp;quot;peritoneum graft method&amp;quot; of vaginoplatsy for example gives much more realistic results for MTF transitions versus any method that would have been available during 1973-2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Societal acceptance has also increased massively since that time period, and transgender people are much more likely to have a support net of family and/or friends. It&amp;#39;s basic evolutionary biology that we as human beings are meant to exist within cohesive social groups. Ostracizing someone from society and family will &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; make them have poor mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people in this study, for the most part, would have transitioned after puberty and would not have had access to vocal training techniques or procedures like facial feminization surgery, which can often times be crucial to helping a post-pubescent transitioned trans woman live seamlessly as a woman in society. Imagine having a surgically crafted vagina but still having a masculine face or deep voice that people constantly treat you like a freak over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;many newer studies&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;demonstrated that social and medical transition is beneficial to transgender people!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/""&gt;https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-analysis on transgender people and the effect gender transition has on their mental health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of 56 studies, 52&lt;/strong&gt; indicated transitioning has a &lt;strong&gt;positive effect&lt;/strong&gt; on the mental health of transgender people and &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; indicated it had &lt;strong&gt;mixed or no results&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZERO&lt;/strong&gt; studies indicated gender transitioning has &lt;strong&gt;negative results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1615012164237000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1__yGu1Yw_sFaVx9uuwKji&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1615012164365000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1lfT3cMxabaflDMcDpAYRz""&gt;https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitudinal study on the &lt;strong&gt;effectiveness of puberty suppression &amp;amp; sex reassignment surgery&lt;/strong&gt; on trans individuals in improving mental outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unambiguously positive results&lt;/strong&gt; - results indicate puberty suppression, support of medical professionals &amp;amp; SRS have markedly &lt;strong&gt;beneficial outcomes&lt;/strong&gt; to trans individuals’ mental health and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, the &amp;quot;41%&amp;quot; suicidal ideation rate is vastly decreased when transgender people, especially transgender youth, are accepted by their family and peers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt; survey shows that &lt;strong&gt;strong parental support of trans youth&lt;/strong&gt; reduces the suicide attempt rate to &lt;strong&gt;4%.&lt;/strong&gt; Numbers may be even lower now since trans acceptance has progressed even further since 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;#39;s address the idea that genital reassignment surgery is &amp;quot;mutilation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even doctors will perform &lt;strong&gt;surgical mutilations&lt;/strong&gt; on these people in order to feed their crazy antics. A delusional man thinks he&amp;#39;s a woman and walks into a surgical clinic to get a vagina, instead they give him an &lt;strong&gt;open wound&lt;/strong&gt; that the transgender needs to &lt;strong&gt;dilate&lt;/strong&gt; in order to stop it from closing up again. Disgusting. So it&amp;#39;s no wonder that they&amp;#39;re so unhinged that they have a &lt;strong&gt;41% suicide rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of language frequently used to paint an image of disgust and medical malpractice in the reader&amp;#39;s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar arguments are made for FTM-related surgeries as well, however for the sake of simplicity I&amp;#39;m going to focus on the MTF-related subject because I am personally more knowledgeable on the subject and additionally these arguments are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More primitive methods of vaginoplatsy exist and are unfortunately still more common, and these may in some cases give less realistic or less desirable results, however I myself am a strong advocate for the newer &lt;em&gt;peritoneum-graft&lt;/em&gt; method of vaginoplatsy, and hope to get it myself eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/a-patient-gets-the-new-transgender-surgery-she-helped-invent/#:%7E:text=02%3A30%20PM-,A%20Patient%20Gets%20the%20New%20Transgender%20Surgery%20She%20Helped%20Invent,and%20turned%20into%20a%20vagina""&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/a-patient-gets-the-new-transgender-surgery-she-helped-invent/#:~:text=02%3A30%20PM-,A%20Patient%20Gets%20the%20New%20Transgender%20Surgery%20She%20Helped%20Invent,and%20turned%20into%20a%20vagina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had the pleasure of even talking to a couple trans women who have had this procedure with positive results, and would suggest reading the above article if you&amp;#39;re curious about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But essentially, you may have heard people say that the inside of a vagina has tissue that is analogous to the inner cheeks of your mouth. It turns out that another bodily organ has tissue similar to this as well, in a protective lining called the &amp;quot;peritoneum&amp;quot; that protects some of your inner organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this method of surgery, the inside of the vagina is crafted using a sample of this tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which means it&amp;#39;s not actually an &amp;quot;open wound&amp;quot; because there is healthy tissue lining the inside of the new vagina.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the purpose of the Dilation isn&amp;#39;t to &amp;quot;prevent the wound from closing up again&amp;quot;, but rather to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the weeks immediately following the surgery, make sure the new vagina retains its shape as it heals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the time after that, make sure the pelvic muscles are acclimated to the new genitalia such that the vagina doesn&amp;#39;t end up too tight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilation is a frequent activity but becomes less needed the more time goes on. Eventually, after a year or so, some surgeons argue that it&amp;#39;s possible to stop dilation completely so long as you masturbate or have sex at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this surgery was originally invented as a &lt;strong&gt;vaginal reconstructive surgery&lt;/strong&gt; for intersex women! So it&amp;#39;s nonsensical to consider it a form of mutilation, simply &amp;quot;cutting your dick off&amp;quot; when the purpose is to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; genitalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people might read this entire post, but if I can change at least a few people&amp;#39;s minds, that would definitely be better than to let these pieces of misinformation continue to spread unopposed. I would like to thank anyone who has made it down this far. Trans people are a troubled group that need care and compassion, and scientific consensus should be followed in regards to how to treat us rather than resorting to armchair psychologists who think they know better than the therapists we see.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with life? It all seems meaningless and just a long grind until you keel over, living an unfulfilled life. You know what, let me sum up every single life phase and what's wrong about them.

&amp;#x200B;

Kid: The best life phase, as I'm sure we can all agree. You don't gotta do shit other then do some basic school work and you get to just hang around, play games with your friends, and just generally relax. This is the life phase that everyone envys, no work, no responsibilities forced on you by society, and no stress from having to pay the bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Teen: The one I'm currently stuck in, it's like being a kid, except objectively worse in every way. More stress, more responsibilites, more people yelling at you to do more things, and hormones stacked on top of all that. The ""freedom"" part I was promised as a kid was total bullshit, I can't do fucking anything as a teen that I couldn't do as a kid, hell even the ""freedom"" of driving doesn't appeal since I have nowhere to go. Plus, you also have to deal with the whole ""everything I say is disregarded by adults because I'm young"" thing, that doesn't matter so much when you're a kid because you don't care about it then, but as a teen, you just feel like nobody older gives a shit about you, which can make the mental health problems that typically develop around this time period worse. That all being said, it's still better then the bullshit that follows.

&amp;#x200B;

Young Adult: Like being a teen, except objectively worse in some ways and objectively better in others. You don't have to deal with all the high school drama bullshit, or being a hormonal teenager who's just sad for no reason, so that's a little less stress. But, in return, you have to work a slave wage for some fat bastard who's never worked a day in his life just to barely pay the bills, and if you're in uni, it's like high school except with even more stress from relationships and work. This is usually the phase where people give up and turn to imbiding toxic liquids and substances just to try and feel anything at all, although the fix is ultimately temporary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mid 30's: This is about the time where society expects people to have gotten married and had kids, even if you don't have the money to do that, and if you haven't, you're just a fucking selfish failiure because you didn't feel like fucking without protection. As for the rest of it, it's pretty much like being a young adult except objectively worse in every way, more societal expectations to be all this even when you're not, more work, more stress, and slowly decreasing health in body.

&amp;#x200B;

Middle Age: This is the phase that just kind of exists, it's kinda like Mid 30's, but objectively worse because you're getting old and your body is starting to deteriorate over time. You're not allowed to have fun anymore because you're supposed to be ""mature"" and shit, no games, no fun, no joy, just work, work, work, work until you die of a stress induced heart attack at age 60. Are you noticing a pattern here? Because I certainly am. On the bright side I suppose, you've hopefully found a somewhat stable job that gives you enough money to support yourself, but by this time that doesn't mean anything to you because you've already lived the ""good part"" of life.

&amp;#x200B;

Old Age: The phase everybody pretends they want to eventually get to but regret it when they do get there, you can't do shit because you're old, the world is so different that you can't relate to anyone born these days, and so you get ostricized and called ""old fasioned"" and ""outdated"". You're looked at as a liability that needs to be put in an old folks home because you can't take care of yourself, and eventually just die from cancer anyways, living an unfulfilling life. If you're really lucky, you might get Altzheimers and slowly forget who you and your friends are, slowly losing the only semblance of fulfillment that you had, until you eventually just keel over anyways.  


Afterlife: After all that bullshit, all that meaningless suffering at the hands of the top 1%, there's got to be something at the end right? Well, sorry to tell you buddy, but nobody knows if what's on the other side is worth all the bullshit that comes before. If the Abrahamic religions are right (Christans, Muslims, etc.), then you get fucked and have to spend eternity in hell unless you bend the knee and swear eternal service to God, so you still have to serve a fat bastard who's never worked a day in his life, just like before. If Buddhism is correct, then you just get reborn and continue suffering anyways as somebody else unless you achive Nirvana, you don't even get to keep your memories so that was all ultimately for nothing. If Hinduism is correct, you also get reborn as something else according to how much of a good or bad person you were in life, despite the fact that evil is almost entirely subjective to what oneself thinks is evil. And if Athiests are correct, then nothing happens, you just cease to be, meaning it was all for nothing anyways.  


Pardon me for thinking this, but why? Why should I put up with this bullshit instead of just blowing my brains out to save me all this hassle, there doesn't seem to be a point in persisting to me at least.

As for the rest of it, it&amp;#39;s pretty much like being a young adult except objectively worse in every way, more societal expectations to be all this even when you&amp;#39;re not, more work, more stress, and slowly decreasing health in body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle Age: This is the phase that just kind of exists, it&amp;#39;s kinda like Mid 30&amp;#39;s, but objectively worse because you&amp;#39;re getting old and your body is starting to deteriorate over time. You&amp;#39;re not allowed to have fun anymore because you&amp;#39;re supposed to be &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; and shit, no games, no fun, no joy, just work, work, work, work until you die of a stress induced heart attack at age 60. Are you noticing a pattern here? Because I certainly am. On the bright side I suppose, you&amp;#39;ve hopefully found a somewhat stable job that gives you enough money to support yourself, but by this time that doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything to you because you&amp;#39;ve already lived the &amp;quot;good part&amp;quot; of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Age: The phase everybody pretends they want to eventually get to but regret it when they do get there, you can&amp;#39;t do shit because you&amp;#39;re old, the world is so different that you can&amp;#39;t relate to anyone born these days, and so you get ostricized and called &amp;quot;old fasioned&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;outdated&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;re looked at as a liability that needs to be put in an old folks home because you can&amp;#39;t take care of yourself, and eventually just die from cancer anyways, living an unfulfilling life. If you&amp;#39;re really lucky, you might get Altzheimers and slowly forget who you and your friends are, slowly losing the only semblance of fulfillment that you had, until you eventually just keel over anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterlife: After all that bullshit, all that meaningless suffering at the hands of the top 1%, there&amp;#39;s got to be something at the end right? Well, sorry to tell you buddy, but nobody knows if what&amp;#39;s on the other side is worth all the bullshit that comes before. If the Abrahamic religions are right (Christans, Muslims, etc.), then you get fucked and have to spend eternity in hell unless you bend the knee and swear eternal service to God, so you still have to serve a fat bastard who&amp;#39;s never worked a day in his life, just like before. If Buddhism is correct, then you just get reborn and continue suffering anyways as somebody else unless you achive Nirvana, you don&amp;#39;t even get to keep your memories so that was all ultimately for nothing. If Hinduism is correct, you also get reborn as something else according to how much of a good or bad person you were in life, despite the fact that evil is almost entirely subjective to what oneself thinks is evil. And if Athiests are correct, then nothing happens, you just cease to be, meaning it was all for nothing anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pardon me for thinking this, but why? Why should I put up with this bullshit instead of just blowing my brains out to save me all this hassle, there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a point in persisting to me at least. Maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong though, what do you all think of this whole life thing?&lt;/p&gt;

So i left uni last year and thanks to covid I've had to take the first job i could get. I stand in the same place for 10 hours a day 4 days a week just doing the same mind numbing shit over and over again, it makes me dread waking up in the morning.

But whenever i complain about it to my parents it's always ""welcome to the real world"" or ""well your going to be working for the rest of your life now so get use to it"". 

This kind of shit doesn't make me feel better or makes me want to work harder it makes me want to throw myself off the nearest bridge to same me the trouble of wasting my life just so someone else can be rich.

I am aware that i need to work to survive and blah blah but would some sympathy or just something else rather than just saying you've had the good part of your life now eat shit till you die or the goverment decides you can retire at the age of 90.

Not really looking for solutions bc i already know them aka get a better job.

If I can’t go back to a school which I really want to I would much rather my little sister get the help she needs. Also, my older sister and I take turns giving her a shower.

So I’ve been talking to this guy since last week (we know each other through family friends). He initiated the text and we have been going back and forth. Yesterday, we talked a bit about our personalities. He mentioned to me how he tends to be more rational/robotic/seclusive. That got me concerned about emotional openness/spending quality time in a relationship. I received this reply earlier:

happy friday!  i'm very excited.  pretty much every friday i think, ""it's already friday, i remember when it was only monday"" - and every monday i think, ""on friday morning, i will be thinking to myself just how quickly the week went by""

yes - it is like a switch that i can turn off and on.  naturally, i prefer it to be off.  i tend to live inside my head and prefer not to socialize, and i suppose its easy to misinterpret what that means.  i was very comfortable meeting your family - even though it has been 8 years since i saw your dad, everyone was very warm and i felt right at home, so thank you for that!  And yes, this is the first encounter of this sort that i've had so i did not/still do not know what to expect.  It's something that my parents mentioned to me and here we are.

i am honest.  if you ask a question i will answer is straightforward.  i am very direct and i do not beat around the bush or play word games or wear a mask - which is something i see far too much of.  life is too short for me to waste my time or anyone else's by pretending to be something/someone i am not.  i see myself in the mirror every day and live with no regrets.  i'll tell you more about this sometime.

it depends on what you mean by emotional openness and your definition of quality time.  to me, quality time means literally spending time with someone.  to others i know, quality time means showing overt physical affection in the open, or even buying gifts/spending money on someone.  to me, the highest level of bliss/quality time could be going for a long drive or going camping or reading a book in the same room as someone, not saying a word the entire time.  or, it could mean going for a very long walk/drive and talking the entire time - about goals, dreams, aspirations, or life in general.  and although it hasnt been an issue in my experience, it is very possible that i am not able to ""deliver"" the level of emotional support that someone ""requires"".  so, apologies for answering this way - but you will need to be more specific in your question.  be open and honest and don't be coy with your questions, and i promise i will answer openly :)

,rant,"I love you so much, and you are generally a pleasure to be around, but I have a few issues I would like to bring to your attention.

First and foremost, the unrelenting assholery needs to stop...immediately. No...don't start rolling around at my feet and twisting yourself into impossible contortions while I am trying to have a serious conversation about this, it isn't going to work....fine have a belly rub, now, let me continue...

Your constant need to be directly in my face whenever I am putting anything into my mouth, whether it is a piece of food, a pill or my inhaler needs to stop immediately, I don't need your paws all over my sandwich, i dont need your nose on my lips, I don't need you biting my inhaler and i sure as hell dont need you licking my face while I am eating, if I wanted my face licked, I'd have gotten a dog....wait, scrap that, I have a dog, and he doesn't behave nearly as terribly as you at mealtimes.

We have an agreement, you know this agreement...when I am done eating, I always leave a little bit on my plate for you and your twin sister to share, you are only to approach the plate when I am done and put it on the side table in the appropriate place. Not when it is in front of me, not when I am still eating, you know this, and still persist. I really do not want to go back to remedial lessons with you, you are 2 years old, and I thought we had moved past the spray bottle.

Second, the constant interrupting is getting old. You know when I am talking to other people that I require no interruptions, we have been over this many times. When I put my headset on, it is in no way a cue for you to start yowling at the top of your lungs for attention, nor is it appropriate for you to try to eat my microphone when I ignore you.

Furthermore, when I am DMing, you are not supposed to try to eat my dice. I have given you your own dice tray, with your own shiny click-clacks in them. These dice and these alone are yours, all other dice are off limits, please stop being a dice goblin.

Third, I would like to address your bed-hoggery. My pillow is for my head, my blankets are to keep me warm, and my face is not a cushion. The bed has designated sleeping spots for you. You may sleep on, behind or in front of my legs, on my hip or in the small of my back if I am laying on my side, on my stomach or between my legs below my knees if I am laying on my back, or in the small of my back if I am laying on my front. You may not, at any time obstruct my breathing with your tail or back. You may not lay on my face, or neck, you may not lay on top of my head or try to push my head off my pillow. There are plenty of other places on the bed you may sleep if you do not want to sleep directly on top of me also, please use them, especially on hot nights.

Speaking of sleeping, If I am using my laptop, would you be so kind as to not block the air vents causing it to overheat? I know it is warm, but this is why I purchased you a heated cat bed, at great expense.

Lastly, your intimidation of the dog needs to stop. He is smaller than you, a little afraid of you and very shy, please stop pushing him around and moving him off of the spots he is laying, if he got there first it is his spot for the day, not yours. He also wants you to back off when it comes to affection. He will tolerate you, but in no way wants you to be rubbing all over him or licking him. He is not allowed to lick, neither are you, so please stop.

I know you are intelligent enough to understand this, you are a highly trainable and very smart feline, and I KNOW you know what you are doing is wrong, so kindly stop being an absolute mongrel.  


Thanks  


Your Human",t2_5z9scycc,False,,0,False,Dear Cat.,[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_lytsf9,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,x,[],{},,True,,1615032925.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love you so much, and you are generally a pleasure to be around, but I have a few issues I would like to bring to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the unrelenting assholery needs to stop...immediately. No...don&amp;#39;t start rolling around at my feet and twisting yourself into impossible contortions while I am trying to have a serious conversation about this, it isn&amp;#39;t going to work....fine have a belly rub, now, let me continue...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your constant need to be directly in my face whenever I am putting anything into my mouth, whether it is a piece of food, a pill or my inhaler needs to stop immediately, I don&amp;#39;t need your paws all over my sandwich, i dont need your nose on my lips, I don&amp;#39;t need you biting my inhaler and i sure as hell dont need you licking my face while I am eating, if I wanted my face licked, I&amp;#39;d have gotten a dog....wait, scrap that, I have a dog, and he doesn&amp;#39;t behave nearly as terribly as you at mealtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an agreement, you know this agreement...when I am done eating, I always leave a little bit on my plate for you and your twin sister to share, you are only to approach the plate when I am done and put it on the side table in the appropriate place. Not when it is in front of me, not when I am still eating, you know this, and still persist. I really do not want to go back to remedial lessons with you, you are 2 years old, and I thought we had moved past the spray bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the constant interrupting is getting old. You know when I am talking to other people that I require no interruptions, we have been over this many times. When I put my headset on, it is in no way a cue for you to start yowling at the top of your lungs for attention, nor is it appropriate for you to try to eat my microphone when I ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when I am DMing, you are not supposed to try to eat my dice. I have given you your own dice tray, with your own shiny click-clacks in them. These dice and these alone are yours, all other dice are off limits, please stop being a dice goblin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I would like to address your bed-hoggery. My pillow is for my head, my blankets are to keep me warm, and my face is not a cushion. The bed has designated sleeping spots for you. You may sleep on, behind or in front of my legs, on my hip or in the small of my back if I am laying on my side, on my stomach or between my legs below my knees if I am laying on my back, or in the small of my back if I am laying on my front. You may not, at any time obstruct my breathing with your tail or back. You may not lay on my face, or neck, you may not lay on top of my head or try to push my head off my pillow. There are plenty of other places on the bed you may sleep if you do not want to sleep directly on top of me also, please use them, especially on hot nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of sleeping, If I am using my laptop, would you be so kind as to not block the air vents causing it to overheat? I know it is warm, but this is why I purchased you a heated cat bed, at great expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, your intimidation of the dog needs to stop. He is smaller than you, a little afraid of you and very shy, please stop pushing him around and moving him off of the spots he is laying, if he got there first it is his spot for the day, not yours. He also wants you to back off when it comes to affection. He will tolerate you, but in no way wants you to be rubbing all over him or licking him. He is not allowed to lick, neither are you, so please stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you are intelligent enough to understand this, you are a highly trainable and very smart feline, and I KNOW you know what you are doing is wrong, so kindly stop being an absolute mongrel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Human&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"something about my mom sets me off. she told me i was chugging my water too fast today and i told her ""shut up, dumbass."" then called her a dumbass like three more times. it's not even just anger issues, i'm just abusive, i know. but she's just as bad so i don't see why she wants to act like such a self-pitying victim all the time; 50% of the time, she doesn't fight back when i yell at her and just takes it and acts pathetic about it.

she enrages me. my dad beat me all the time and she stood by and laughed and told me i deserved it. told me to shut up and stop crying. told me to get up off the floor and go away. we used to have a good relationship until i realized she would never ever be on my side. she would use me as an emotional buffer for her problems with friends, family, etc. but then completely ignore me when i had issues. she also would hit me before my dad started working less and could come home and hit me instead.

i don't get her. when i yell at her, like when i called her a dumbass, she acted like a pathetic battered wife. started speaking in quiet mumbled sentences and didn't fight back. my dad has never hit her- he saved all that for me! my dad yells at her and i guess sometimes aggressively, but it's Nothing like how he yells at me. and i don't get why when i get physical or verbally abusive on her she doesn't fight back. it's like she WANTS to be a victim, she deliberately puts on this sad timid look and won't hit me, when she had ZERO qualms about doing it back when i was still a weak little kid.

anyway when i was younger she also used to rat me out to my dad all the time to get him to hit me. she would bring up things he had hit me for before in the past MONTHS later and he would hit me again. she would pull this shit all the time. when we had arguments and my dad was sleeping, she would raise her voice on purpose to wake him up. then he would get up, blame me, and hit me.

so now i'm 18 and for the past 4 years i've been getting increasingly more abusive towards her. yeah sure she hits back and yells back sometimes, but other times she just shuts up like she's a fucking battered abuse victim and i'm the only shithead in the house. and it's not like i really hit her anyway, i just punch her shoulders and shove her and only like once every two months. it's not like i'm gonna pull a fucking dad and smack her around every day.

it makes me mad bc it feels like she's trying to guilt me. it's like she's trying to act like i'm the only one who's ever pulled this shit. and it's not even like i act half as cruel or violent as my dad does, not that she would know because she was always getting him to hit me!

why the fuck is she pulling this victim shit? why the fuck won't she fight back? she can't be okay with me shoving her around, but five out of ten times she'll just stand there and let me do it.

don't fucking understand it and it angers me. i know i have anger issues, i just got a therapist thru my school counseling services so i'm gonna try to work it out.

anyway what the fuck is wrong with her, makes me feel sick seeing her act like a little victim. i never acted like that. she'll purposely go around the house moping. she'll hunch over her shoulders on purpose and i KNOW she's doing it deliberately bc it's so exaggerated. it's like she has a boner for wanting to be ME, because i had to sneak around the fucking house trying to hide and stifle my crying so many fucking times.

don't know why she's fucking acting like this as if she's the victim in this household. tells me i'm abusive all the time. well *i* know i am but does SHE know she is",t2_kmqjot9,False,,0,False,"don't get why my mom acts like a battered victim, enrages me",[],r/rant,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_lytrcb,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615032810.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.rant,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;something about my mom sets me off. she told me i was chugging my water too fast today and i told her &amp;quot;shut up, dumbass.&amp;quot; then called her a dumbass like three more times. it&amp;#39;s not even just anger issues, i&amp;#39;m just abusive, i know. but she&amp;#39;s just as bad so i don&amp;#39;t see why she wants to act like such a self-pitying victim all the time; 50% of the time, she doesn&amp;#39;t fight back when i yell at her and just takes it and acts pathetic about it.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"I feel like this is possibly not the best subreddit for this but I need to get my thoughts out of my head and since I'm not in counseling anymore I just have to turn to the internet. The bolded parts are the most important so just skip over everything else if you're gonna skim it.

I don't know how to feel about my relationship with my parents. I'm 22F and since I moved out of the house my relationship with my parents feels so fraught. **We were always a close family growing up.** I had kind of the picture perfect upbringing. 2 stable parents and 1 brother. They were both very present and active in parenting. I used to get spanked and once my mom popped me in the mouth (lightly) when I was about 13. It didn't hurt but that's the kind of thing you don't forget you know. My dad yelled a lot but other than that there was nothing that I think could be considered abusive. They were nitpicky though, **my mom always had something wrong with me** especially when I was like 13 and younger. My hair was wrong, my handwriting was bad, my posture was wrong, etc etc etc. There was always something I could work on it seemed like. Grades had to be top notch. **But they were very involved in our lives**, concerned about us kids, took us on vacation and gave us presents at Christmas and all that. So they weren't negligent parents. And I have great memories of going on vacation with them, times when they were nice and funny, times when they were kind. And those are great memories, and I know they were doing a good job in those areas. When I was really young I clung to my parents because I was nervous around other people. So it makes my feelings about them now that much more difficult. **But they were so strict even up through high school.** What you could consider helicopter parents.

I had an anxiety disorder that my parents did not treat when I was young. Like this was a bad mental illness that destroyed parts of my childhood. I was in literal agonizing mental pain for months on end with very few breaks from about the time I was 6 to the time I was 13. My parents were both well aware that I had this problem and did nothing. They listened to me talk about my ""worries"" but my mom just told me I need to stop worrying so much. **They did not treat my mental health disorder.** I consider this equivalent to not treating a child who has chronic pain or some other illness. I had to get help on my own when I moved out.

I'm in college now and I have my own life, but my parents are still *very* involved in my life. **My parents are my number one source of stress.** They make my business their business, especially when it comes to my post-graduation job search and ""what's going on in my life"". I'm always worried about pleasing them. My parents and I are at odds with each other ideologically in a lot of ways. They're conservative, religious, anti-drug, etc. I'm more liberal, atheist, I smoke a ton of pot, I'm bisexual, and I conflict with their worldviews in so many ways. My parents know some of my worldview (like that I'm vegan and more socially liberal) and they don't like it too much. But I keep huge portions of it, like my sexuality, atheism, drug use, and all that really hidden from them. **Big, huge parts of my identity have to be hidden from them or else they'll tear me apart.** So I get to hear them rag on atheists, LGBT people, and people who smoke weed, all the time. (So you can imagine what it was like for me to grow up in a super homophobic household knowing I'm secretly bisexual and hearing constant homophobic crap.) Based on what they've said about those groups, they would NOT be happy if they were to find out I belonged to all those groups. And I feel like if they knew these things about me, their opinion of me would just be even worse.

I feel like I don't have good interactions with my parents anymore. It feels like there's some big major fight over nothing that my dad will blow up on me for no reason about every other time I come home. Even when it's supposed to be a happy occasion, there's gotta be some fight, problem, or heavy conversation where they tell me I'm doing something wrong. Once or twice a year, my dad will have a HUGE blowup about something. **And on the days when we don't have fights or big heavy conversations, I'm super anxious and walking on eggshells that we will have one.** I hate going home because of it. Our fights have gotten nastier over the last couple years. We've talked about it but it never leaves me feeling any better. Recently they started coming down on me about my weight which has really, really destroyed my self confidence and made me feel awful.

**The thing that really hurts me is, a lot of times my parents can be really nice and kind.** Even most of the time. They give me money, they say they love me, we can have a pleasant conversation on the phone. **But I feel like this is all contingent on maintaining the appearance I present to them**. At the end of the day, I kind of view them as like, a really oppressive manager that you're pleasant with when things are good, but will come down on you extremely hard whenever they feel like you're not measuring up. I don't think ""the real me"" is a person who they will ever really like or love. I feel like I have more negative feelings about my parents than positive. They say they're happy with how I'm doing but that's just because I'm doing a good job hiding all the parts they don't like. Every little smiley emoji, every happy text from my parents, every time they give me money, fills me with guilt because it all feels so fake.

At the end of the day, I can't even really put my finger on what they're doing wrong. We fight quite a bit when I'm around them, and I hide big parts of myself from them, but it's all wrapped up in this pleasant cheerful façade. They're not abusive, I don't think. But my relationship with them is so unhappy. I don't think I'd have to be on antidepressants if it wasn't for them. I don't think I'd have suicidal thoughts if it wasn't for them. I think I'd love myself more if it wasn't for them. I just want to have a happy relationship with my parents. **I feel like my ideal situation with them is to have a relatively distant/surface level relationship that is cheerful and not very deep, where they do not inquire into my life beyond my daily activities, and we all just stay chill and don't have conflicts.** I'm about to graduate college and become completely independent from them, so I hope things take an upswing soon.

Even when it&amp;#39;s supposed to be a happy occasion, there&amp;#39;s gotta be some fight, problem, or heavy conversation where they tell me I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong. Once or twice a year, my dad will have a HUGE blowup about something. &lt;strong&gt;And on the days when we don&amp;#39;t have fights or big heavy conversations, I&amp;#39;m super anxious and walking on eggshells that we will have one.&lt;/strong&gt; I hate going home because of it. Our fights have gotten nastier over the last couple years. We&amp;#39;ve talked about it but it never leaves me feeling any better. Recently they started coming down on me about my weight which has really, really destroyed my self confidence and made me feel awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The thing that really hurts me is, a lot of times my parents can be really nice and kind.&lt;/strong&gt; Even most of the time. They give me money, they say they love me, we can have a pleasant conversation on the phone. &lt;strong&gt;But I feel like this is all contingent on maintaining the appearance I present to them&lt;/strong&gt;. At the end of the day, I kind of view them as like, a really oppressive manager that you&amp;#39;re pleasant with when things are good, but will come down on you extremely hard whenever they feel like you&amp;#39;re not measuring up. I don&amp;#39;t think &amp;quot;the real me&amp;quot; is a person who they will ever really like or love. I feel like I have more negative feelings about my parents than positive. They say they&amp;#39;re happy with how I&amp;#39;m doing but that&amp;#39;s just because I&amp;#39;m doing a good job hiding all the parts they don&amp;#39;t like. Every little smiley emoji, every happy text from my parents, every time they give me money, fills me with guilt because it all feels so fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I can&amp;#39;t even really put my finger on what they&amp;#39;re doing wrong. We fight quite a bit when I&amp;#39;m around them, and I hide big parts of myself from them, but it&amp;#39;s all wrapped up in this pleasant cheerful façade. They&amp;#39;re not abusive, I don&amp;#39;t think. But my relationship with them is so unhappy. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d have to be on antidepressants if it wasn&amp;#39;t for them. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d have suicidal thoughts if it wasn&amp;#39;t for them. I think I&amp;#39;d love myself more if it wasn&amp;#39;t for them. I just want to have a happy relationship with my parents. &lt;strong&gt;I feel like my ideal situation with them is to have a relatively distant/surface level relationship that is cheerful and not very deep, where they do not inquire into my life beyond my daily activities, and we all just stay chill and don&amp;#39;t have conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m about to graduate college and become completely independent from them, so I hope things take an upswing soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. I know this is long but it felt good to get it out.&lt;/p&gt;

,rant,"Back in 2018 I met my best friend(I’ll call him Omar.). My girlfriend had just broken up with me and I was really broken, I honestly was so excited to make a friend. My living situation ended up changing in 2019 and we got a place together because we never fought, we both worked, and I was young and thought it was the best decision, it really was my ONLY option. 

 Fast forward to now and we’re coming up on 2 years living together. I have a wonderful girlfriend now. I was supposed to live with her but things changed and she moved in with us in our two bedroom. We’re 5 days away from getting our keys to our new place that we’re all moving into together for a year before her and I get our own home, and I just have a fewww things to say. 

This past 24 months has made me hate him. I will never understand how someone could not understand basic principles like cleaning up after themselves, doing their fucking dishes, not being so cheap to the point where people can’t stand them. Being so lazy that literally their only tasks involve playing fucking mobile phone/console games, eating 2-3 foods like a toddler on repeat like a fucking parrot. Spending every mother FUCKING day doing the SAME thing. Like I shit you not, I will go to work or go study for college with a friend and come back 6 hours later and he is in the SAME fucking place. Only thing that has changed is the amount of plates that increased around him. I work LONG shifts and I come home to the house and it smells like hotdogs, barbecue sauce, chips, ass, and fucking stagnation. Like why the fuck do I have to deal with this? I am very clean, I vacuum twice a week, do the dishes before bed. Etc. and now that my girlfriend lives with us, she also is very cleanly and pretty anal about stuff. I will come and clean the entire house with her and not even two days later it will smell like what I previously listed above. We say something and he gets offended and acts like he’s not the one making the mess and insists that it’s us. So we all try to do better. We all do our dishes every night. He does it for 3 days and then he’s back to his fucking bullshit. If I or my girl friend don’t do them they will just KEEP GETTING WORSE. He works a dead end job that he hates and constantly complains about, but he won’t stop smoking weed long enough to find another one. 

He puts a strain on my relationship of a year now because he is always just doing something fucking stupid. She’s graduated from college and I’m in it now. To hear someone BRAG about how they didn’t do good in high school fucking ASTOUNDS us. I’m constantly the middle man between the two of them and I’m sick of it. My gf is patient, and kind, and absolutely SICK OF HIS SHIT. I am too! He is so fucking cheap it hurts, he doesn’t do good with girls, even though he’s always talking about matching with people on tinder, and we have never made fun of this or made him feel weird because that’s just not cool. But HOLY SHIT IF I’VE EVER SEEN A BLIND PERSON. we try to get him out sometimes, even if it’s just a walk on a nice day or whatever it may be, and he’d prefer to sit inside and play his fucking mobile games. The reason he is single is because no girl wants a tooth pick, smelly, no hobby having, unintelligent, unmotivated, dirty, cheap, complacent, arrogant, ass hole of a boy friend. When we have social gatherings, me , my gf, my friend and I have some mutuals, so we often celebrate holidays together as a big group. I’m tired of us trying to create a nice social and fun/lit environment and then him having to constantly 2 hours into everyone drinking and having a good time either suggest or put on fucking video games while we’re all listening to music on the sound system. I swear it’s like he moved out just so he  could laze around all day with no responsibilities. I was taught every way from Sunday on how to be clean, respectful, motivated, willing to do things, etc. he’s just so hopeless. He’s going to be stuck at this part time job for the rest of his life and come home and play video games everyday. When I look back at my twenties they are going to be fun, and learnable memories, I try to do something every day that at very least gets me off the couch. Usually my day consists of running around and being busy with college and stuff. I handle all the bills. All the cleaning. When he says he’s gunna “change his oil” that means I will will be the one out there with a fucking wrench in my hand like a fucking monkey while he watches me and takes 10 years to even finish hand removing FUCKING TIRE BOLTS. I love him and I have tried so hard to get him motivated or doing something, but he’s just such a fucking loser. 

And what’s even worse is that he brags about how busy he is and how much of a loser everyone he works with is. I swear he does everything half assed. To him taking out the trash is a two part job. PUT A FUCKING BAG IN IT. I have to hound him to even do the first part. You tell me you want to get out so I invite you out for drinks. You tell me you don’t have enough money but then go buy another eighth of fucking weed. The only things you are passionate about literally consist of video games and you 3 foods. Learn to fucking shower more, get off your ass, do something besides video games, learn to eat something other than 3 things, be my friend again, do something, go somewhere, just something. Just stop being a. Fucking. Loser. 

When the year is over and her and I get our own home, I want you to know that this friendship is going to end because I can’t stand you anymore. You have become a lazy, weed addicted, snarky, asshole, lame of a person and I miss my best friend.

She retired too early because she couldn’t learn the new system at her job and as a result fell behind on bills and they end up claiming bankruptcy, I don’t know what chapter.

,rant,"Alright,

Full disclosure: I'm going to go wide with this. Mentions of abuse, along with speculative ramblings that are very much open to opinion. I'm not sharing this for pity, but rather just sharing it to share it.

Growing up, I would often bury myself in comics or manga. Having a father who had some very strange and aggressive thoughts regarding other men- especially his son, I always found myself caught between the memories of his abused childhood and his personal opinions on masculinity. He'd moved from the midwest to New Jersey chasing a failed body-building career. I don't need to tell you that the world of 80s professional bodybuilding was...not good for the creation of toxic masculinity, jealousy, and anger.

Though he kept a desk job during the early years, he would eventually transition to construction. Making himself into a kind of trinity of masculine ideals (Lifter, Builder, and Bully) I was perpetually bullied for not being  ""enough."" Working hard-enough, earning enough, being ""man"" enough, or strong enough. When things were good, he'd like to wrestle me, proving that he was stronger and usually with an audience. When things were bad, he wasn't so playful. When hiding in my room didn't work, I tried my comics, and I remember the day even they were ripped from my hands. It's like he was furious that I would attempt to leave the presence of his rage, even in the sanctity of these fictional worlds. That without me being the subject of his anger, there would be no reason for it, and HE would be made foolish by it. 

The only peace I found was choosing to work with him on the job sites. He had a lower opinion of me than even I did, and was convinced that putting me to consistent work was the only way to keep me from the proofless evils I was no doubt always meant for.  It was never to learn. I was never trusted with tasks. I was only ever given two jobs— To haul, and to smash. 

Working in construction meant remodeling, and remodeling meant kitchens, dens, basements all needed to go. And since I was never ""smart enough"" to be trusted with larger tools, I would be given a sledgehammer, a wheelbarrow, and a direction. From young enough to hold a hammer to my early 20s, if I didn't have a job that paid ""well-enough,"" every weekend was the hammer and a wall. Over and over-- Concrete, tile, drywall. 

I'd come home with my arms and back on fire. Covered in drywall and stone dust...and he would leave me alone. I was in pain, but it was a ""man's pain."" I ached for the right reasons and earned peace. In many ways, I think I became a writer because it lets me express myself in a way I could keep from people. It's much easier to fold a paper than muffle a voice, after all. And whenever I would speak about him, it would become a shout very quickly.

Now, being the geek I am, there was never a second that passed where I wouldn't hope to someday be strong like my favorite characters. To bring it all down and be freed by my own strength. To hurt the world like I was hurt and make it right. Not to balance THE scales, but to balance MY scales. That's when I started to gravitate to the Hulk.

In many ways, I loved what he represented, but loathed the reality of its result. His was a rage-untethered, but because of that Bruce could and would never have a happy ending. It was the strangest feeling, to see so much of myself in a character, but not in a positive way. In a private, shameful way. I hate that I know I have a temper and that it's cost me more than I will ever really understand.  I hate that there's an eternal-ember of rage in my heart that will not smother, and it's more than willing to catch. I hate that a part of me loves the feeling. It is a selfish, righteous rage.  But it is clean. It is clear. It is the rage that levels anything in its way, but the problem is... well, it does exactly that.

So! I try my best to funnel those feelings into productive channels. But never has there been a fictional character that I identify so much with, and realized how bad that is, before. Because abuse is a cycle, and knowing that so much of what I am is part of that is a jagged pill to swallow. So, I'm trying therapy. I'm trying to get better. But again, like Banner and the Jade Giant, I'm not sure what healthy looks like when my most unhealthy qualities have been part of me since the earliest years.

I believe that we are all the same and of equal value, with the exception of child molesters and the kid who stole my iPod touch when I was 15. *In general*, I believe that we all have the same inherent value by virtue of being human. That being said, simply knowing that we’re all the same doesn’t exactly make you feel better when you read about how awesome of a life Justin Bieber lives. It doesn’t make you feel better when you are intimidated by the prettier lady or stronger guy. Nor does it make you feel better when you discover all your friends are buying houses and you’re still living in the same shabby apartment eating buckets of ramen. It’s unfortunate, but natural to place people on a higher pedestal than your own when you’re feeling insecure. Perhaps this is why people often lose themselves to self-help gurus or cult leaders. It blows my mind that people will abandon their families just because they view another human being and their rhetoric with such importance. That being said, I don't think I'm better than other people just because they join a cult, that would contradict this whole post. After all if Kurt Cobain were still alive and touring I'm sure I would be throwing my underwear on stage and behaving like an obsessed lunatic. But most of us aren't in cults or behaving like an obsessed teenager, most of us are dealing with other regular people and typical feelings of inadequacy. Having been a collegiate athlete, I know the hell that comes with comparing your self worth to others, especially when it’s as tangible as a scoreboard. One thing that has helped me when the comparison sharks are swimming in my head is a perspective shift I coined; The Bathroom Theory. 

First and foremost, what you are about to read is simply ridiculous, but effective if done correctly. The Bathroom Theory comes in handy when you feel yourself becoming insecure, jealous, or intimidated by another person. It could be the stronger guy at your gym, your boss, celebrities, or your smarter sibling. I devised The Bathroom Theory because I was going through a particularly difficult time regarding my position in life, and I viewed everyone around me as doing better by every possible metric. I thought they were just better than I was. The Bathroom Theory requires you to be imaginative as well as courageous. It’s remarkably simple and juvenile as well, which is part of its genius. All you have to do is imagine the person you’re comparing yourself to, amidst the throes of a diarrheal episode. You heard me right, fully commit to the image of the person straining, quivering, and possibly sobbing on the toilet. 

Like I said before, it’s not enough to just tell yourself that your scary boss is flesh and blood like you, it takes a severe mental image to that point across. The genius of The Bathroom Theory is that the occasional bathroom atrocity happens to literally *everybody*. Nobody is exempt. It doesn’t matter if you’re Kim Kardashian or Jason Momoa, there’s a solid chance either of them have had the runs within the last week or so. Does the image of tall, broad-shoulderd Jason Momoa quivering on the toilet ruin his sex appeal? I thought so. By putting a mental image of the person that’s causing your insecurity on the toilet, it shows them at their most vulnerable and most humiliating. Just like that, your feelings of insecurity will be lifted, at the least it will make you chuckle. It will work wonders next time your daughter is obsessed with the latest bad boy at school, just place the image of Mr. Bad Boy straining at the toilet and that will take care of any unwanted fantasies.
